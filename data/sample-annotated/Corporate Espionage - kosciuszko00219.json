1. **Key Judgements:**<br><br>&nbsp; * **<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node38\">It is unlikely that JEFFRIES&nbsp; is committing corporate espionage based on information presented at hand</span>, however <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node41\">due to limited intelligence further investigation is recommended to address intelligence gaps. </span>**<br>&nbsp; * **<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node44\">It is highly likely that JEFFRIES&nbsp; was being truthful during the polygraph test.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node45\">The probability that JEFFRIES lied on Question D of the polygraph is 13.15%.</span>**<br>&nbsp; * **<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node48\">Statistically, the probability that JEFFRIES will commit intellectual property theft or corporate espionage is 47.84% due to&nbsp; displaying both scanning and access behaviours within the 'Indicators Check'.</span> **<br>&nbsp; * **<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node53\">It is highly likely that JEFFRIES’ drug test was accurate (negative) with a 6.74% chance that the result produced a false negative.</span>**<br><br>&nbsp; 2. **Background &amp; Fraud Research:**<br><br>2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To consider the espionage threat and broader implications for Ultimate Audio (UA), a background assessment of the main drivers of corporate espionage follows.<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node54\">The motivations for corporate espionage are most commonly money, ideology, coercion or ego.</span><br><br>2.2 _&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**Financial motivatio**_ **n**<br><br>2.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node55\">Financial motivation, personal gain and organisational, is a primary factor for espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node58\">A stolen piece of developing technology could be worth many millions for a company</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node59\">UA projects earnings from a successful launch of MAX10 to be a $5 million earnings increase.</span><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.2.2&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node62\">Fierce competition is reported in the industry.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node63\">Tzuyu LEE (LEE) the head of Queen Tech Technology desires exceeding competitor developments and be the leader of the sector.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node64\">Queen Tech, NewTekDev and UA, all have significant risk of financial losses if new technology is leaked.</span>&nbsp;<br><br>2.2.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node68\">If espionage is occurring the desired data which will exist in four forms: paper, visual, oral and electronic, and obtained through any of these channels.</span> Therefore, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node67\">security measures employed by UA will alone not protect their company.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node71\">An individual engaging in espionage can obtain the information and transfer it in many ways</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node74\">opportunities to transfer verbally may present themselves to JEFFRIES</span>.<br><br>2.2.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node80\">Personal financial motivation risk factors are present for JEFFRIES.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node84\">There is the availability of a motivated customer for corporate secrets, QueenTech and NewTekDev</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node87\">the reading interest JEFFRIES has in start-ups and enterprise.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node90\">Phone records for JEFFRIES also indicate he has a current financial preoccupation exhibiting unusual behaviour of bank numbers being of most dialled numbers.</span> Alternatively, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node93\">if at present JEFFRIES is establishing his own enterprise</span>, (indicated by <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node94\">his researching entrepreneurs start up and visual cryptography, watermarking, and steganography</span>), then <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node97\">frequent calls to his bank are plausible</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node102\">The books also have an author with the same surname</span>, therefore <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node103\">he may have a contact with that name, hence the interest in those particular books</span>.<br><br>2.2.5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node109\">Espionage is more likely in an environment of wealth, and an important driver is envy towards those with wealth.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node112\">JEFFRIES resides in Kingston, considered a contemporary, modern in the top 10 highest socioeconomic suburb of Canberra.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node113\">JEFFRIES may have an image he wishes to create or uphold, driving the desire for financial incentives.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node116\">JEFFRIES has been noted working long hours, which may be due to wanting higher wages, rather than opportunities for espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node119\">Brian Diaz (DIAZ) has expressed his desire of material things in a car, with the same photo captioned by JEFFRIES.</span><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>2.3 _&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ideology, philosophies and belief_<br><br>2.3.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node126\">Contributing to increased occurrence of espionage is decreased employee loyalty and a phenomenon of job-hopping.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node127\">JEFFRIES has demonstrated such behaviour with his employment history.</span> However <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node136\">such behaviour can be attributed to the fact that one employment was an internship and JEFFRIES is under 30 years of age.</span> In addition, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node140\">JEFFRIES has been in the same employment for 3 years, reported to be hardworking by his previous employer and current manager states he is dedicated</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node147\">A more poignant point regarding loyalty is JEFFRIES' call register and his frequent communication with Peyton Winger (WINGER)</span>, although <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node150\">in this context it is unsubstantiated to be indicating connection with espionage</span>.<br><br>2.3.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node153\">More indicative of a threat of espionage is low company loyalty coupled with additional individual and organisational factors.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node154\">The person situation interactionist approach demonstrates the interaction between individual factors (such as morality, locus of control, ego strength, field experience etc.) and situational factors within organisations (such as trust, reinforcement, obedience to authority, responsibility for actions, role taking etc.) as a predictor of espionage.</span><br><br>2.3.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node157\">JEFFRIES requested advice from HR regarding inappropriate comments</span>, and it appears <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node158\">he didn’t receive a reply</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node159\">Such an event creates a high risk situation if other factors are also in place, due to personal vendettas, individual levels of moral development and perceptions of organisational reward and punishment</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node164\">A week later, office conversation overheard regarding JEFFRIES working odd hours.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node165\">This claim was not backed with further information indicating unethical behaviour, and may be due to employee jealously and trying to outdo JEFFRIES who is viewed as achieving new developments and valuable employee.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node168\">The timing of an anonymous complaint of JEFFRIES working suspiciously being received a week later does not add circumstantial credibility to the claims.</span><br><br>2.3.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node173\">The bad barrel approach must be assessed here as it suggests that organisational and societal factors take precedence in explaining unethical behaviour.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node174\">The research suggests that organisational factors such as leadership, reward systems, codes of conduct and norms and culture can significantly influence the likelihood of unethical behaviour.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node177\">If JEFFRIES holds a grievance against the perpetrators of alleged harassment or the company for inaction</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node178\">the absence of trust in the organisational environment can contribute to the creation of untrustworthy work practices</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node181\">JEFFRIES mentioned names, Paul Gertrude and James Bourne (BOURNE), in the email altering HR to the behaviour, which increases the indicated strength of accuracy in the allegations.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node182\">He has also indicated he is challenged by unkind people.</span><br><br>2.3.5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node189\">The “distrust breeds distrust and ultimately betrayal” is illustrated as a cycle; manager observes employee action, manager forms assumption, manager takes protective action, employee observes managers action, employee forms assumption, employee takes protective action, managers negative assumptions are reinforced.</span><br><br>2.3.6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this way, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node192\">the controlling measures undertaken by UA could exacerbate the distrusting elements in the organisation and create further distrust.</span> In addition, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node195\">computer monitored employees, a measure undertaken in UA, suffer to a greater level stress, health and morale problems.</span><br><br>2.3.7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node199\">These factors may increase the risk of espionage conducted by JEFFRIES</span>, however <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node210\">unsupported by other equally weighted factors.</span><br><br>2.4 _&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Coercion and cooperation_<br><br>2.4.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node213\">Individuals who have unmet goals are more likely to engage in unethical behaviours regardless of economic incentives.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node214\">Information indicates JEFFRIES has goals, with an interest in entrepreneurships and conventions.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node215\">In addition to his academic achievements and age, JEFFRIES may be under family pressure to perform.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node216\">He may also have high expectations on himself.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node217\">If the individual is just short of achieving goals the likelihood to espionage is intensified, which may be relevant in JEFFRIES case</span>, however <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node218\">without further personal information this is able to be substantiated</span>.<br><br>2.4.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node221\">Recruitment is an essential component to enable espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node222\">JEFFRIES is highly regarded employee, high performing and instrumental in developing new technology.</span>&nbsp; If <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node229\">Queen Tech has the desire to develop and recruit JEFFRIES to perform espionage for their benefit</span>, there is <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node230\">employment history and social contact historical factors making the situation viable</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node233\">The relationship between LEE and WINGER could have devised and facilitated JEFFRIES employment projectory for the purpose of gaining UAs technology.</span><br><br>2.4.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node238\">JEFFRIES has ongoing high frequency contact with an individual with high influence in NewTekDev</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node239\">there is no information to date to indicate that there is a relationship between LEE and JEFFRIES</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node244\">LEE has displayed unusual behavioural characteristics which may be evident of ulterior motives, through the interview she provided which unusually diverted to discussion on her renovated apartment.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node247\">This behaviour indicates a relationship between LEE, the interviewer and magazine</span>, which <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node250\">may be insignificant</span>. There is also <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node255\">no information to indicate that the high frequency call contact with WINGER is unusual or sudden</span>.<br><br>2.4.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node258\">The risk of an individual engaging in espionage is raised in group situations where dishonest behaviours are witnessed.</span> Additionally, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node259\">individuals will behave in a selfish, less ethical and dishonest ways if they are psychologically close to someone who engages in unethical acts</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node262\">These factors are not consistent in JEFFRIES situation as he completed internship during a formative age, with Queen Tech who are reported to not tolerate espionage behaviour and view it seriously, and his current workplace associates have worked on high security projects.</span><br><br>2.5 _&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personal characteristics, ego, self-image_<br><br>2.5.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node269\">Regarding personality and characteristics, Machiavellianism is seen as the strongest predictor of unethical intentions in individuals.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node276\">Machiavellianism is a personality trait involving manipulativeness, deceit, cynical views, and cold calculating behaviour.</span> This indicates that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node278\">the level of threat posed by an individual can be identified by analysis of their indicative characteristics and the underlying traits of Machiavellianism which is crucial in espionage behaviour.</span><br><br>2.5.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node291\">Information obtained regarding JEFFRIES personal characteristics do not meet the description of Machiavellianism.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node296\">JEFFRIES is described as friendly, well liked, and holds values of kindness highly.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node299\">JEFFRIES has demonstrated behavioural reliability in similar positions to that which he currently holds establishing the likelihood he is consistent in personal characteristics.</span><br><br>2.5.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node302\">Self-image indicators including location, powerlifting, in-trend dog breeds, young age, influence of social networks, conventions and ‘beautiful’<br>people without correlation with other high risk factors do not provide substantive personal characteristics relevant to the occurrence of espionage.</span> In addition, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node305\">information may indicate that JEFFRIES may be stressed at work or home, and employs unhelpful coping techniques</span>.&nbsp; However <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node308\">alcohol, stress ball, medication without context are unable to reliably indicate such behaviour.</span><br><br>&nbsp; 3. **Intelligence Findings:**<br><br>&nbsp; * 3.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node311\">The activities JEFFRIES has undertaken in the past 4 weeks are assessed as being part of the work required in the lead up to the release of a new product – the MAX10 - and are unlikely as evidence of corporate espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node314\">It is almost certain that JEFFRIES’ activities are due to his relationship with DIAZ and trying to start a family through the surrogacy process.</span>&nbsp;<br><br>3.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Furthermore, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node321\">the assortment of medication and pills found on Shane’s desk are not indicative of illegal drug use</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node319\">All the medications are legal and their use is associated with assisting in fertility problems and healthy pregnancies.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node328\">It is assumed that the two females in DIAZ’s Instagram post about brunch are surrogates for JEFFRIES and DIAZ to start a family.</span> Based on this assumption, the <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node331\">transaction of $9,800 of ‘cover costs’ from JEFFRIES and DIAZ to MJ and SC is possibly for costs associated with this surrogacy process.</span><br><br>3.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node336\">The books on his desk align with the hobbies and interests listed on Shane’s resume.</span><br><br>3.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node339\">The erratic timing of JEFFRIES’ hours at the office are not indicative of corporate espionage, but rather are likely to align with the extra work required towards the end of a large project.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node344\">Intelligence gaps remain whether anyone else in the team is also working erratic hours.</span> That said, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node347\">accessing worksites at unusual times and working more than anticipated are noted as behaviours indicative of fraud.</span><br><br>3.5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Given <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node350\">the hypothesis that JEFFRIES is in a same-sex relationship</span>, and that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node353\">he had raised concerns about homophobic comments that went un-addressed by the company’s HR area</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node354\">an accusation of corporate espionage could be seen as targeted and discriminatory against an individual who identifies as LGBTQI</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node362\">This in turn could lead to significant reputational effects for the company, if it wrongly accuses a LGBTQI employee or corporate espionage, on the basis of very circumstantial evidence.</span><br><br>3.6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node371\">The current nature of JEFFRIES and WINGER’s relationship remains an intelligence gap.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node376\">WINGER’s presence on the list of JEFFRIES' recent calls indicates contact between the two, but the nature of that contact is unknown</span>. As such, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node381\">the relationship between JEFFRIES and WINGER, and the relationship between WINGER and LEE does not support the hypothesis that JEFFRIES is passing corporate information to Queen Tech via WINGER.</span><br><br>3.7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node390\">The reason for the transfer of a $21,900 ‘gift’ from Beige Lawyers to the joint account of JEFFRIES and DIAZ also remains an intelligence gap.</span> Whilst <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node396\">the transfer of such an amount could indicate a payment for JEFFRIES passing on UA’s corporate information to Queen Tech</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node399\">there is no identified connection between Beige Lawyers and Queen Tech</span>.<br><br>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.
