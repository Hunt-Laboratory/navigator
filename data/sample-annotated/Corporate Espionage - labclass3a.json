&nbsp;<br><br>#### **Corporate Espionage**<br><br>**Risk Threat Consultancy Group report to Ultimate Audio (UA)**<br><br>**Assessment of Shane Jeffries (Staff ID 23AB), UA Technical and Product Development Team**<br><br>Background<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node1\">Shane Jeffries has recently been the subject of a complaint from a fellow Technical and Product Development Team Member, James Bourne, regarding his odd working hours.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node2\">Shane Jeffries’ role in the development of MAX10</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node5\">the upcoming release of MAX10</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node6\">the importance of this release to UA</span>, have <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node7\">made necessary an investigation of this complaint and an assessment of the employee</span>. The following assessment takes place ahead of any formal or overt investigations and its aim is to determine any further course of action, including the termination of Shane Jeffries’ employment at UA is 1) warranted, and 2) advisable, given the contingencies at play. &nbsp;<br><br>_Assessment of Employee's Position Suitability_<br><br>1.&nbsp; Shane Jeffries Prior Work History<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node14\">Shane Jeffries has previously worked as a Junior Technology Developer at NewTekDev and Queen Tech, for the same amount of time (6 months)</span>, then <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node15\">he participated in a month-long internship with Queen Tech</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node16\">He has been employed at UA for three years.</span><br><br>2\\. Employee Statements<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node17\">Linda Kim (Jeffries’ Supervisor): Shane Jeffries is a valuable member of her team</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node18\">his participation is critical to the release of the MAX10</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node21\">He is open about his past history with Queen Tech.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node22\">She was not aware of the inconsistencies in Jeffries polygraph testing.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node25\">She trusts him and thus does not observe his work closely.</span><br><br>Missive from James Bourne (Jeffries’ Colleague) to Linda Kim: <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node28\">In an email, Bourne relayed a conversation that he overheard, which discussed how Jeffries had been working odd hours.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node31\">This seems like a somewhat unreliable source. &nbsp;</span><br><br>Jimmy Langford (UA Security Team Leader): <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node34\">Jimmy has passed onto us a complaint Jeffries’ has sent through to HR that was never addressed.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node35\">Jeffries states that “Paul Gertrude and James Bourne made inappropriate comments, which I would categorize as homophobic . . . I’ve been trying to avoid them as much as I can but it’s hard when you work in the same team.”</span><br><br>3\\. Probability Testing<br><br>**ProbabilityQuestion&nbsp; 1: ** According to the polygraph results,&nbsp; what is the percentage&nbsp; (%)&nbsp; probability that Shane Jeffries lied on Question D during the polygraph?<br><br>&gt;88%<br><br>**Probability Question 2:** Given the findings of the ‘Indicators Check’, and assuming an initial probability of theft equivalent to the probability that Shane lied on the polygraph, what is the probability that Shane has or will perpetrate acts of IP theft or espionage?<br><br><img><br><br>&gt;P(Shane is perpetrator|Shane displayed scanning behaviour)<br><br>=0.63*0.88/(0.3333*0.12+0.63*0.88)<br><br>=93%<br><br>&gt;P(Shane is perpetrator|Shane displayed accessing behaviour)<br><br>=0.81*0.88/(0.25*0.12+0.81*0.88)<br><br>=95%<br><br>**Probability problem 3:** Given that we do not know which model Security Officers used to test the sample and that Shane’s test was negative, what is the probability that the result is a false negative reading?<br><br>Percentage of adults within Jeffries (27) age bracket, (20-29,) that take illicit drugs – 28%<br><br>DD3-U (updated, 31% of stores)<br><br>&nbsp; * false positive rate of 6%<br>&nbsp; * true positive rate of 93%.<br>&nbsp; * false negative/true negative = rate of 1%<br><br>DD3-O (older, 69% of stores)<br><br>&nbsp; * false positive rate of 23%<br>&nbsp; * true positive reading 81% of the time.<br>&nbsp; * therefore OF the true positive reading, there is a 23% that is it a false positive<br><br>Given that Shane used the DD3-U:<br><br>100 - (31% x 93%) - (31%x6%)<br><br>100 - (28.83% ) - (18.6%)<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node37\">Probability of false negative OR true negative = 52.57%</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node36\">Data is still inconclusive.</span><br><br>4\\.&nbsp; Analysis of Schematics, Exit/Entry Logs and Printer Records<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node38\">In the lab, Shane’s desk is closest to the Secure Lab, which requires a swipe access to enter and prohibits mobile phones.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node40\">He also had in his possession a copy of ‘ _Ultrasonic Transducers: Materials and Design for Sensors, Actuators and Medical Applications (1st Edition)_ ’ edited by K Nakamura and a copy of ‘_Handbook of Image-based Security Techniques_ ’ by Jasjit Suri, Shivendra Shivani, and Suneeta Agarwal, neither of which were relevant to his job as a Technology Developer for UA.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node41\">According to Building Security entry/exit logs, Shane entered Braddon office at odd hours</span>, which does provide Bourne’s rumour with more solid evidence. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node44\">Logs report that he arrived at 5am, on a Wednesday 2 weeks ago.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node50\">At the same time (Wednesday, 2 weeks ago) printer records show that Jeffries printed an unusually large number of documents – 15 in total. </span>&nbsp;<br><br>3\\.
