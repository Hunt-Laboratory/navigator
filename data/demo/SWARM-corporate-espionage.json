The investigation has determined the following –<br><br>&nbsp; * RTCG believes that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node1\">the probability that JEFFRIES is undertaking corporate espionage and/or is suitable to continue in his role is too close to 50% to justify an overt investigation.</span> Furthermore, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node2\">there is reason to believe that the accusation is false</span>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node9\">While available evidence taken as a whole could indicate that JEFFRIES activities are due to him undertaking corporate espionage, the evidence could equally be related to innocuous activities</span>.<br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node12\">The probability that JEFFRIES was lying when he answered question 4 of his polygraph test is 13.15%.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node13\">The probability that a person lying on question 4 and undertaking scanning and accessing behaviours, as JEFFRIES was, is engaged in espionage is 48.10%.</span> <span class=\"highlighted hlcurrent\" id=\"node14\">The probability that JEFFRIES’ recent drug test returned a false negative result is 6.91%</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node15\">aligns with prior tests indicating a very high probability that he is not a long term drug user</span> (See Appendix 1). <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node16\">When considered together this evidence does not give a clear indication that JEFFRIES is engaged in espionage</span>.<br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node21\">Current UA security procedures may not detect all anomalies in staff activities, and it appears that some noted inconsistencies have not been fully investigated.</span> This <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node22\">presents a potential risk to UA that confidentiality and secrecy may be breached</span>.<br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node25\">It is unclear whether the mobile phone/removable media locker denoted on the lab schematic includes technology to prevent wireless transmission of data, eg a Farraday cage.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node26\">A complaint submitted by Shane JEFFRIES related to harassment based on sexuality was not actioned by Human Resources for 2 weeks, presenting a risk to UA both financially and reputationally.</span><br>&nbsp; * Evidence suggests that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node31\">James BOURNE may be responsible for the anonymous letter</span>, as <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node32\">retaliation for JEFFRIES’ complaint to Human Resources</span>.<br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node35\">UA currently has a contract with the Department of Defence to develop military grade audio technology</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node36\">accusations of espionage are likely to have significant repercussions for this contract</span>.<br><br>**Recommendations**<br><br>&nbsp; 1. At this time, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node41\">RTCG recommends further investigation of Shane JEFFRIES' activities to determine whether recent anomalies and policy breaches can be attributed to activities that are not malicious in nature</span>. Given the <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node42\">tenuous connections between current evidence and the possibility of corporate espionage</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node43\">this investigation should remain covert in nature to prevent the loss of JEFFRIES, a high-quality employee</span>. 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node46\">UA should investigate to determine the author of the handwritten note, and RTCG recommends the use of handwriting comparisons during this investigation.</span>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node47\">All security procedures and policies should be reviewed to ensure that there is periodic assessment of staff behaviours and a clear plan of action to uncover and investigate anomalies.</span>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 4. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node56\">UA should ensure that the mobile phone/removable media locker outside the lab protects UA from unauthorised wireless transmission of data.</span> 5. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node59\">RTCG recommends that a general security review of all staff should be undertaken to ensure that security policies are being/have been adhered to.</span>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 6. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node62\">Urgent action should be taken to resolve the HR complaint from JEFFRIES to reduce the level of financial and reputational risk to UA.</span>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 7. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node67\">A review of the Department of Defence contract should be undertaken to ensure that UA has met all reporting standards in relation to espionage, whether proven or unproven.</span><br><br>**Reasoning**<br><br>RTCG assessed all information and evidence provided by UA. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node70\">If the evidence was taken at face value and as a whole, it could be considered reasonable to assume that the accusation of corporate espionage made against JEFFRIES is accurate.</span> However, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node73\">when the evidence is more thoroughly assessed it becomes clear that each piece of evidence could be considered in the context of innocuous and innocent activities, albeit activities that may not meet with UA administration policies</span>.<br><br>Firstly, it is concerning that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node78\">the accusation was made anonymously</span>. This <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node79\">could indicate a workplace culture where direct communication is not a preferred option or where there is concern for repercusions</span>. However, it <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node82\">could also indicate that the veracity of the contents should be questioned as anonimity prevents confirmation of the claims with the witness</span>. When aligned with <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node87\">the email from James BOURNE, which also questions the behaviour of JEFFRIES</span>, it is reasonable to consider that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node88\">BOURNE may in fact be the author of the accusation</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node98\">Without further investigation, RTCG is unable to unequivocally determine the motivation of the author</span>, however if it was indeed BOURNE the HR complaint from JEFFRIES offers important context. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node103\">RTCG considers it likely that the anonymous letter was written in retaliation for JEFFRIES’ complaint and/or to diminish JEFFRIES’ reputation to allow BOURNE to further his own work.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node110\">The evidence provided by UA following their covert investigation has a range of alternative interpretations other than JEFFRIES engaging in corporate espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node113\">RTCG therefore recommend that the evidence has insufficient weight to justify decisive overt action.</span> For example, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node116\">a large portion of evidence (including JEFFRIES’ working hours, document scanning and printing activities, phone log, medications and bank statements)</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node117\">could also be an indicator that JEFFRIES and DIAZ have entered into a surrogacy agreement</span> rather than an indicator of corporate espionage. While this is only one possible scenario, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node127\">it demonstrates the need for further investigation to determine whether these activities are innocuous or malicious</span>.<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node142\">There is a clear connection between JEFFRIES and Queen Tech (QT)</span> – <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node143\">his former employment with QT directly</span>; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node146\">his work with NewTekDev, which is managed by Peyton WINGER, husband to QT’s Head of Technology, Tzuyu LEE</span>; and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node149\">the use of WINGER as his referee</span>. However, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node152\">connections of these kinds are not unlikely in a relatively small industry</span>. JEFFRIES’ former employment with QT and NewTekDev is as likely to represent a strategic career path as it is to <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node153\">represent engagement in corporate espionage</span>. Similarly, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node161\">JEFFRIES’ apparent interest in start ups in the technology sector could simply be a future goal and/or related to his current employment</span>. In fact, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node159\">he may be seeking information regarding new technology or high achieving staff to assist in his own work</span>.<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node166\">The complaint made by JEFFRIES to HR is concerning</span> for a number of reasons. Firstly, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node167\">the fact that BOURNE and GERTRUDE felt able to make such comments</span> and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node170\">the lack of action by HR</span> suggests <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node173\">a culture where staff wellbeing is not highly valued</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node180\">This has implications for UA both reputationally and financially</span>, particularly <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node181\">if JEFFRIES decides to take the complaint further and holds UA responsible for creating an unsafe working environment by not actioning his complaint</span>. Further, when considering the email from BOURNE to KIM regarding the “odd” behaviour of JEFFRIES, it seems likely that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node186\">the anonymous letter may have come from the same source and that both may have been written to try to undermine JEFFRIES’ position at UA and/or as retaliation for the HR complaint</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node189\">It is essential that UA takes action to determine the author of the anonymous letter and, given it was handwritten, using hand writing comparisons of staff members would be beneficial.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node192\">If BOURNE is found to be the author and the claims made can not be substantiated</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node195\">UA will need to consider whether disciplinary action against BOURNE is appropriate</span>.<br><br>**APPENDIX 1.**<br><br>RTCG was requested to answer three probability-based questions.&nbsp; These questions were about the interpretation of test results.&nbsp; It is important to note that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node207\">the probability of a 'true positive test result' is not the same as the probability that a positive test result reflects the truth</span>.<br><br><img><br><br>Bayes' Theorem allows us to account for this.&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node208\">All of the answers below rely on the statistics and test results provided by the client, and assume that those are accurate</span>.<br><br>**Question 1: <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node209\">The probability that Jeffries was lying on question 4 is 13.15%**.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node214\">Even though the polygraph is 89% likely to give a true positive, the likelihood of a false positive is far higher which reduces the significance of the polygraph finding.</span><br><br>**Question 2: <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node235\">The probability that a person reported to be lying on question 4 and scanning and accessing is engaged in espionage is 48.10%</span>.**&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node222\">Combining the tests increases our confidence, but the result is not definitive.</span><br><br>**Question 3: <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node225\">The probability that the most recent ‘all clear’ drug test result is false is 6.91%</span>**. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node230\">This is based on calculating the probability of a false negative from the U test, the probability of a false negative from the O test, and then assuming that the probability of using the O test is equal to the proportion of O tests in stock (69%).</span>&nbsp; We also calculated <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node233\">the probability of three false negatives: 0.41%.<br></span><br>**APPENDIX 2.

Shane Jeffries is engaged in IP theft is 48%.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node5\">This is the combination of the probability that he lied on the 4th polygraph question (13%), with the finding that he has displayed both \"scanning\" and \"access\" behaviours in the last 6 weeks.</span> However, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node8\">the weakness of the direct evidence against him</span> leads to us conclude that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node9\">the actual probability of such activity is more likely in the range 20--30%</span>.<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node16\">The probability that the result of SJ's drug test is a **false negative** is 7% .</span><br><br>## Key Judgments<br><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node17\">SJ is the victim of a malicious campaign by a co-worker</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node18\">is planning to leave the company</span>.<br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node21\">There is a worrying level of interpersonal rivalry/conflict in the Technical and Product Development Team which needs to be addressed</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node22\">SJ should be offered an opportunity to air his concerns and grievances</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node29\">every effort should be made to address these to preserve UA's reputation as a company that attracts and keeps the most technically talented people, and for the future viability of the company</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node34\">A possible first step would be for his line manager to reach out to him, using the \"odd hours\" behaviour as the pretext, and offer personal leave</span><br>&nbsp;

1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node50\">The handwritten note, delivered to HR's mailbox, accusing him of this</span>. 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node57\">His extremely irregular working hours and \"odd\" behaviour over the last 3 weeks.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, we have <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node60\">some ambiguous polygraph evidence</span>; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node71\">inconclusive IT usage records</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node74\">\"suspicious\" bank transactions</span>.<br><br>Considering each of these in turn:<br><br>### 1\\. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node79\">The \"tip\" to HR was a malicious act by a team rival, most likely James Bourne</span><br><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node82\">The \"informant\" appears very keen not to be identified -- the note was hand-written and hand-delivered to a physical mailbox. It was also expressed in rather childish terms -- eg. \"giving away all our hard work\"</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node87\">JB also informed on SJ's \"odd hours\" to their manager, and explicitly linked this to his desire to have his (JB's) work receive higher priority</span><br>&nbsp; *&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node90\">When called out for remarks that SJ felt were \"inappropriate\" (homophobic), JB did not respond at all, possibly indicating a deeper level of hostility than casual bigotry or dislike.</span> This contrasts with <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node93\">the conventionally dismissive response given by the other party to the conversation (Paul Gertrude).</span><br><br>### 2.&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node96\">The irregular working hours are a reaction to the interpersonal conflict with co-workers</span><br><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node101\">Up until 3 weeks ago SJ's working hours were entirely regular.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node104\">The timing of his absences in week T-3 would accord with an interstate trip: fly out on Wednesday afternoon; return late on Thursday. The purpose of the absence is unknown; one possibility is to attend a conference, perhaps the conference mentioned in his instagram post about a week later.</span>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node107\">On the Monday of week T-2 he throws himself back into work; not leaving until 11pm.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node110\">The next day he leaves at 3pm; later it is discovered that he sent an email to HR about this time regarding the \"inappropriate\" remarks made by his co-workers.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node113\">On Wednesday he arrives at 5am and leaves at 1pm; supporting the supposition that he is trying to minimize time spent in the lab with the rest of the team. We note that the lab in which they all work seems (from the schematic) rather cramped, thereby increasing the discomfort occasioned by the conflict.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node116\">The rest of week T-2 he seems to be waiting for a response from HR; none was received.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node121\">By Week T-1 he has apparently decided enough is enough (ref. the \"enough\" image posted on instagram about this time), and seems to be preparing to leave UA. He comes in for 2 hours on Monday, leaves early on Thursday, isn't seen on Friday; and comes in on the weekend just to do a heap of copying and printing.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node126\">We conjecture that he has always intended at some point to start his own business, and has now decided to advance this plan (ref. the book on Startups, and the StartCon pamphlet).</span><br><br>### 3.&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node129\">The polygraph \"evidence\" is both unreliable and irrelevant.</span><br><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node132\">A very high probability of both false positive and false negatives</span>, combined with <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node135\">the very low incidence of IP theft in the relevant population (2%)</span> implies <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node138\">the machine has only a 13% chance of correctly detecting a lie (based on a single question).</span><br>&nbsp; * We note however, that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node145\">we have only the first 4 questions in what was presumably a longer interview</span>. The first 3 are warmup questions, meant to establish as baseline for truthful responses and allow the subject to relax. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node148\">The 4th question is one to which there is only 1 acceptable response (\"No\"), yet any person with an imagination would have to answer \"yes\" if they were being completely truthful. It is possible that this was actually a control question --- ref. [Scientific Validity of Polygraph Testing: A Research Review and Evaluation, chpt 2.]</span><br><br>&nbsp; * We also note that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node151\">UA Recruitment did not \"follow up\" the alleged inconsistencies -- perhaps because they also believe that the test is unreliable and/or irrelevant</span>.<br><br>### 4\\. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node155\">The \"scanning\" and \"access\" behaviour is at most inconclusive</span><br><br>&nbsp; *&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node158\">When combined with the apparent lie on the polygraph test the presence of these behaviours implies a 48% probability that SJ \"has or will perpetrate acts of IP theft or espionage\".</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node163\">If we discount the polygraph results entirely, beginning instead with the 2% probability of IP theft in the relevant population, then this falls to 11%.</span><br><br>### 5\\. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node166\">The bank transactions pertain to a private surrogacy arrangement</span><br><br>&nbsp; 1. The evidence for the surrogacy arrangement is highly circumstantial; largely resting on the supposition(1) that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node169\">SJ is in a stable long-term relationship with his partner (Brian Diaz)</span>, yet is <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node172\">apparently taking a cocktail of medications related to male infertility</span>(2). We also note <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node175\">BD's recent post regarding brunch with \"these beautiful people\"; referring to a female couple who might be \"MJ and SC\"</span>. 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node178\">The $9,800 transfer to \"MJ and SC\" to \"cover costs\" is then for the additional insurance cover to cover the `gap' in normal health insurance. This doesn't cover IVF and is usually around \\$9-14K in Australia.</span> 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node181\">GIFT or [Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer] is an IVF procedure that involves fertilisation of an egg with sperm from a donor. The cost of this treatment in Australia is around \\$20,000</span>(3)<br><br>(1)Supported by the fact that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node184\">SJ &amp; BD have a joint back account</span><br><br>(2)<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node187\">As found in the Security check of SJ's workdesk.</span><br><br>(3)<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node190\">This does require a somewhat roundabout transaction chain to account for the inconsistent direction of the transfer</span> --see Fig.1 below<br><br><img><br><br>Fig,1 Legal/financial arrangements for GIFT/surrogacy<br><br>## Contending hypotheses<br><br>### 1\\. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node194\">SJ is engaged in IP theft</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node195\">motivated largely by unhappiness with his treatment by UA</span><br><br>The argument here follows from that outlined above, except <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node198\">SJ is now focused on launching his own company, and, feeling no particular loyalty to UA because he feels mistreated, is actively taking steps to maximize his chance of success by stealing work currently under development, either in the expectation of being able to further develop it himself, or to sell to a 3rd party</span>. In this scenario&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node201\">the book on visual cryptography&nbsp; was acquired for this purpose</span>. A possible scheme might work as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; 1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node204\">SJ brings his phone to work, as usual, with some photos on it. The phone goes into the locker on the outside wall of the lab. It is not switched off. 2. The&nbsp; phone locker happens to be on the other side of the wall from SJ's desk; unless the lab has been setup as a Faraday cage it would be possible for SJ to connect to the phone from his workstation; download the photos from it; add the encryption layer, and send them back to the phone.</span> 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node212\">If the room is a Faraday cage he would need to breach it; the feasibility of this depends on the nature of the wall.</span><br><br>**Counter-argument:**&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node215\">if SJ had in fact decided to help himself to the team's work, surely he would not be acting in such a way as to bring negative attention on himself while he did it.<br></span><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node218\">If SJ _was_ engaged in IP theft then the question of whether the \"3rd party\" is in fact Queen Tech (QT) becomes relevant.</span> Here we note that<br><br>&nbsp; 1. SJ is on very good terms with Peyton Winger, his former boss at NewTekDev (NDT) 2. Peyton Winger is married to Tzuyu Lee, the head of technology development at QT 3. Tzuyu Lee has very recently claimed to be certain of \"matching and exceeding \" whatever their competitors put forward. 4. SJ and his partner Brian Diaz have recently received $21,900 labelled \"GIFT\" from an unknown source using a legal firm as an intermediary.<br><br>Supporting evidence for the \"Startup\" hypothesis&nbsp; is <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node219\">the possession of ‘How to Start a Startup: The Silicon Valley Playbook for Entrepreneurs’&nbsp; and a StartCon 2020 brochure.</span> A potential counterargument is <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node222\">the purchase of the car; while not wildly expensive (the car is a Hyundai i30 N-line), he would surely want to preserve as much capital as he can, if only for contingencies.<br></span><br>### 2\\. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node225\">SJ is not engaged in IP theft, but has let it be known that he is leaving UA</span><br><br>The impact here could be just as serious, because it's immediate. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node226\">If Linda Kim is right, and the MAX10 launch depends crucially on SJ's input</span>, then <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node227\">it will fail if he leaves beforehand (the launch is in 3 weeks)</span>. In this scenario, SJ lets PW know of his problems at UA; perhaps in return for a modest consideration, with the result that TL knows that UA will likely not have a product to present at the SOUND Forum.<br><br>## Key assumptions<br><br>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node230\">That SJ's atypical behaviour of the last few weeks is indicative of a man in turmoil, not a singularly reckless thief.</span><br><br>## Key unknowns<br><br>&nbsp; 1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node241\">Where was SJ on the days in week T-3 and T-1 when he was absent from work?</span>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node244\">Why has there been no review of the secure lab's network and server logs for the most recent 3 weeks?</span><br><br>## Impact on UA's viability<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node247\">The UA Finance Dept. have produced a pair of projections for the next year.<br><br>&nbsp; 1. The MAX10 launch is successful: earnings increase 50%; the share price increases 10%<br>&nbsp; 2. The MAX10 launch is not successful: earnings fall 20%; the share price falls 10%</span><br><br>Accordingly, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node250\">if Linda Kim is correct, and the MAX10 is certain to fail if SJ resigns or is dismissed</span>, then the situation seems clear: <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node253\">every effort must now be made to persuade SJ that he does indeed have a future at UA, and his concerns will be addressed.</span><br><br>While <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node261\">LK is SJ's line manager</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node258\">she seems to be doubling as the project manager; if so we can assume she knows what she's talking about</span>.

Under these assumptions the difference in earnings between the two&nbsp; cases is less than \\$4,000,000;</span> naturally, the lower the value we assign to LK's credibility, the smaller this becomes.

1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node42\">His strong academic results – per his CV – 1st class Hons in Engineering from a top tier Australian University</span> 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node43\">All jobs since leaving university have been in the same technical field</span> 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node44\">His glowing prior referee report from his most recent job at NTD – per referee report from Peyton – “his skills are second to none”</span><br>&nbsp; 4. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node55\">His glowing referee from his current line manager – per line manager interview from Linda Kim</span> – <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node58\">“he is my best employee, pivotal to the development of MAX10, without him the project would fall apart”</span> and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node61\">“he is very friendly with her and the rest of the team”</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node64\">“he is dedicated to the work and the company”</span>. 5. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node67\">The fact the MAX10 project is a high value project for his current employer, and how important Shane is to the project – it seems he is pivotal to the company’s economic prospects on this project</span><br><br>### Workplace fit<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node72\">Prior referee from NTD – “he is friendly employee who got along with everyone he met”</span><br><br>#### Current job – positives<br><br>&nbsp; 1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node75\">Shane has been at UA for 3 years</span> – suggests <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node76\">he has loyalty to this employer noting his previous two jobs were much shorter (6mths each).</span>&nbsp; Other than <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node79\">one report to HR two weeks ago</span>, we have <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node80\">no evidence that Shane is unhappy at work – indeed, he seems to be working on a key project and seems to be liked by his manager and to get along with his peers.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node87\">He seems hardworking and dedicated.</span> 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node90\">Shane has been recognised at work – line manager reports Shane is “pivotal to the development of MAX10, without him it would fall apart”.</span>&nbsp; We know <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node93\">MAX10’s release will be economically important to UA – it will add $7 million to projected earnings, almost doubling returns for the company for the year.</span><br><br>#### Current job - negatives<br><br>&nbsp; 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node96\">Shane’s report to HR of homophobic slurs in the workplace by his team members James and Paul 2 weeks ago.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node101\">Unclear what, if any, response the workplace has made to support Shane.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node104\">If Shane thinks he isn’t being supported through workplace harassment scenario, this can contribute to him feeling unhappy at work.&nbsp;</span><br>&nbsp; 4. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node107\">Report to Shane’s line manager from colleague James, saying he overheard Pam telling Nick “Shane is working odd hours and wants to know what Shane is up to” then coupled with request that the manager “prioritise” James’ tech proposal over Shane’s work.</span>&nbsp; This suggests <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node108\">friction in the workplace between James and Shane</span> – and suggests <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node111\">possible jealousy on the part of James.</span>&nbsp; We know <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node118\">Shane is integral on the MAX10 project.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node121\">Maybe James is feeling sidelined and wants more of the action and is using Shane’s “odd hours” as a justification to sideline Shane’s work and promote his own</span> – this seems pretty weak justification for <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node122\">deprioritising the economically lucrative MAX10 project.</span> 5. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node125\">Shane’s recent Instagram post “be nice to people it’s not that hard”</span> – suggests <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node126\">someone is not being nice to him.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node131\">This may be a reference to his colleagues’ behaviour and that it is affecting him negatively.</span><br><br>### Indicators of potential corporate espionage<br><br>#### Supporting indicators<br><br>&nbsp; 1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node135\">Line manager interview Linda Kim – “she did not need to overly manage Shane as he often did his own thing”.&nbsp; Lack of supervision and working on his own represents a vulnerability – easier for him to undertake insider behaviour.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node138\">His desk position is somewhat private such that he could be accessing information on his computer without colleagues having good visibility.</span> 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node141\">Change in his work hours from 3 weeks ago – went from being consistent every day during core hours 4 weeks ago, to coming in at different times including some very early starts, very late finishes, and working on weekends.</span> 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node144\">Printer records shows that during the days where he was in the office, there were corresponding patterns in his activity – e.g. Wednesday 2 weeks ago he was in the office from 0500hrs and did an uncharacteristically high degree of printing</span> (15); <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node147\">on all the weekend days he was in the office he did both printing and scan/copying including on the most recent Sunday he was in for an hour he printed 8 documents. </span>4. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node152\">IT audit – showed scanning and access 3-6 weeks ago.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node155\">No information on his scanning or access during the past 3 weeks.&nbsp; If we assume no information = no activity, could suggest he hasn’t done any “suspicious” behaviour in that time.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node158\">BUT maybe he didn’t have to because he scanned and accessed material of value 3-6 weeks ago and moved it all to his personal directory to then access/copy/print later at his leisure. During the past 3 weeks he may have printed/copied and removed any material.</span> 5. While <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node164\">UA Security have advised that they have not observed Shane removing any documents relating to technical capability development</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node161\">we have no information about the robustness of UA Security’s checking procedures</span>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 6. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node167\">The polygraph result when he was first hired 3yrs ago at UA – “is there any reason why you would not maintain the confidentiality and secrecy requirements of a role with UA” – NO – polygraph says he is lying.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node170\">If he was in fact lying, could indicate he took a position with UA intending to breach confidentiality/secrecy.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node175\">He has in the past 3yrs worked his way to an integral position in the MAX10 project.</span> 7. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node180\">The handwritten anonymous note to HR 3 days ago saying Shane is secretly working for Queen Tech suggesting longstanding suspicions about allegiances confirmed in the last few days – he is stealing and providing secrets to the competition – Queen Tech.</span> 8. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node186\">Shane has previously worked at Queen Tech</span> – but, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node189\">he’s been open about that, it was on his CV</span>.&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node192\">He has indirect social connection to Queen Tech’s Head of Technical Development as Tzuyu Lee is married to Shane’s former boss at NTD Peyton.</span> 9. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node195\">Shane was in possession of a book on how to start your own start-up and attended a conference recently which was possible StartCon 2020 (pamphlet discovered in his desk and social media post indicates he attended a conference where he met amazing people).</span> 10. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node198\">Indications of financial issues:&nbsp;</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node201\"> Instagram – Shane showing off picture of brand-new car – the source of funding for the car is currently unexplained</span> and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node204\">further inquiries should be conducted to determine whether the funds were received for nefarious activity</span>. 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node209\">Based on Shane’s age, according to recent statistics, there is a 28% chance he has illicitly used drugs in the last 12 months. While his drug test returned a negative result it is possible the test was faulty.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node210\">An ongoing drug habit might indicate financial difficulties.</span> 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node215\">The phone calls to the bank about loans may indicate financial difficulties.</span><br><br>#### Alternate explanation / mitigating factors<br><br>&nbsp; 1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node218\">Doing his own thing with minimal supervision</span> – <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node221\">this could just indicate his ability to work autonomously and can be trusted with less oversight</span>. 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node225\">Workplace conflict</span> – <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node228\">he feels uncomfortable in the workplace given he’s experiencing homophobic slurs from his peers, so is coming to work at odd times to avoid them.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node233\">Re the printing and scanning behaviour during non-core hours – UA Security say they did not observe Shane removing documents relating to technical capability development.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node236\">Given there are indications Shane is interested in starting his own company his scanning and access behaviour may be in the interests of making a career change.</span> 4. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node239\">Re IT audit – non-perpetrators also show scanning and access behaviour.&nbsp; So, detection of him showing these behaviours is not on its own evidence of insider activity.</span> 5. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node242\">Re polygraph result: 1. There is a 12% chance the result for Question D was a false positive</span> 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node247\">Shane could have been lying, but for a reason unrelated to corporate espionage e.g. he would consider breaching confidentiality but only if his life were threatened</span> 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node250\">It is possible HR did follow up the question and he gave a satisfactory explanation, meaning HR were satisfied that he didn’t pose an insider threat risk, but this wasn’t recorded anywhere</span> 6. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node253\">Shane’s partner also posted about the car online.&nbsp; It’s unclear who bought the car – Brian or Shane.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node256\">We don’t know about Brian’s financial situation – maybe he earns a higher salary than Shane.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node259\">We do know Brian recently received a significant financial “gift” from lawyers which could have covered the expense of the car.</span> 7. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node262\">We don’t know who the source of the anonymous tip is, we don’t know what their credibility or motivation is.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node265\">We don’t have an evidence base underlying their allegation.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node268\">It is feasible that it is a vexatious allegation made by one of the two individuals who are subject of the complaint made by Shane 2 weeks ago.</span> 8. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node271\">Shane is a smart, hard worker.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node274\">He seems to have particularly strong and creative technical skills.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node277\">After a few years getting experience in tech firms, it would not be unusual for him to consider starting his own company.</span> 9. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node282\">As a 27-year-old professional, it is not an unusual time of life to seek a loan e.g. to buy a property.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node285\">We don’t know what the loan is for and would need to make further enquiries to confirm.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node288\">It may be that he is seeking finance for a potential start-up venture.</span><br><br>### Repercussions of accusing Shane of insider behaviour<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node293\">Shane is integral to MAX10’s success.</span>&nbsp;

**<br><br>Listed below is an analysis of the likelihood Shane Jeffries is committing corporate espionage for Queen Tech.&nbsp; It is our advisement that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node3\">there is not enough evidence of guilt to investigate Shane</span>, given <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node2\">what UA risks by investigating him</span>.&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node13\">It has been advised by line manager Linda Kim that termination of Shane’s employment or him quitting due to false accusation would mean UA would not be able to release the MAX10 as projected.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node16\">The risk of losing Shane as an employee and allowing Queen Tech to capitalise at the upcoming SOUND FORUM is too substantial with this amount of circumstantial evidence surrounding this situation.</span> Although <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node24\">if Shane was stealing from UA this would significantly damage future technology development and the company’s longevity</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node23\">the part of this risk attached to the upcoming SOUND FORUM is shared by either investigating him or not.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node31\">There are several other possibilities to explain the evidence against Shane.</span> They are explored below along with the indicators of his guilt.<br><br>**Shane’s work history and employer evaluation**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node36\">Before recognising any indicators of Shane’s possible guilt, it is imperative to appreciate his value as an employee</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node37\">In addition to Shane’s roll in the upcoming project, Shane has displayed in his current and previous jobs that he is both capable and constantly improving.</span> The following quotes provide a small summary.<br><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node40\">“Shane leveraged his training in sound engineering in a way not seen by others of his age to develop new audio/headphone technology” - Peyton Winger; Manager at NewTekDev </span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node43\">Linda Kim Shane’s line manager described Shane as her best employee. </span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node46\">Shane was very friendly with her and the rest of the team. </span><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node49\">Linda Kim said she did not need to overly manage Shane as he often did his own thing and could be trusted to pursue a project. </span><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node52\">Kim said Shane was dedicated to the work and the company.</span><br><br>**Polygraph analysis**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node61\">UA requires that all employees that work in the security division undertake a polygraph during the recruitment process then every five years once employed.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node62\">After the test asked Shane a series of very simple questions to test the answer of the machine</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node63\">it showed that Shane lied on the question \"Is there any reason why you would not maintain the confidentiality and secrecy requirements of a role with UA?\"</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node64\">Taking into account the amount this polygraph fails, the probability that this lie was a true positive is&nbsp; **88%**.</span> However, although <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node65\">this appears incriminating</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node70\">this question is ambiguous and stress-inducing, especially in comparison to the very straightforward previous questions</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node75\">We need to consider this probability in context of what that means for Shane actually being a perpetrator of corporate espionage.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node80\">Given statistic that 2%of participants are involved in insider IP theft or espionage and lie on their polygraph we can calculate the probability that Shane is a corporate spy and lied on his polygraph is 13.15%.</span> This is not negligible, and these statistics together definitely warrant interest, however its worth noting that for the purposes of this analysis, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node83\">13.15% is a much more meaningful statistic than looking at lying behaviour on the polygraph alone</span>.<br><br>**HR reports and co-worker disputes**<br><br>Note the following reports/emails indicating <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node86\">turmoil with Shane and co-<br>workers;</span><br><br>**_Two weeks ago_**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node89\">Email from Shane to HR;

This is a substantial probability however <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node129\">this was based on the probability that Jeffries lied on question D as the probability Jeffries will commit theft</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node132\">The framing of question D was ambiguous enough to discredit the hypothesis that the probability associated with lying reflects the probability one will actually commit theft.</span> Therefore <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node135\">we may consider a lower probability than 45% as the actual probability Jeffries committed theft via these behaviours</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node142\">which makes keeping him onboard much more favourable</span>.<br><br>Looking at <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node147\">the time logs and printer records provided by UA</span>, there is no question that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node148\">in the last 3 weeks Shane has begun working much more irregular hours</span>. It is also concerning that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node151\">his printing and scanning activity is higher on those days where he is likely to be working with less or no other people in the office</span> (Average 2.26 documents when working regular hours, average 5.66 when working outside these hours). However, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node156\">this could also be explained by Shane avoiding his co-workers</span>, which <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node159\">he has explicitly stated in his email to HR that he was doing</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node162\">Changes in work hours could also be explained by a multitude of reasons relating to Shane’s personal life.</span><br><br>**Connection to Queen Tech and NewTekDev**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node176\">Shane’s connection to Queen Tech is undeniable.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node172\">Having been previously employed at Queen Tech and also at the NewTekDev which is owned by the husband of the owner of Queen Tech, it seems Shane has strong ties there.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node181\">He also had a glowing reference from Peyton Winger his Manager at NewTekDev. </span>However, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node184\">as reported by Linda Kim, Shane does not hide his affiliation and talks about it openly.</span><br><br>**Drug taking behaviour**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node187\">Shane tested negative to the companies most recent drug test and to the two previous.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node188\">Given the reliability of the test and these results, the probability that Shane did consume drugs given that he tested negative is 6.9%</span><br><br>**Conclusion**<br><br>The conclusion and recommendations of this analysis are as follows;<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node191\">If Shane is stealing technology and remains employed</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node192\">it hurts the longevity of UA</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node195\">If Shane isn't stealing and is fired or quits due to being falsely accused</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node196\">UA loose almost their current annual company earnings</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node199\">As stated by Linda Kim, losing Shane would mean UA would not be able to release the MAX10 as projected allowing Queen Tech to capitalise at the upcoming SOUND FORUM.</span> Given that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node202\">this upcoming convention has such a large financial implication for the company</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node211\">it would be unwise to take action before this</span>. <span class=\"highlighted hlcurrent\" id=\"node216\">Additionally, if there is some corporate espionage taking place between these companies, it seems likely that it will be revealed at SOUND FORUM as Queen Tech as their CEO has claimed “their company will be at the forefront of their field, noting they will both match and exceed what their competitors can put forward”.</span><br><br><br>","kosciuszko00219":"<br><br>**Shane Jeffries Assessment of Suitability Report:**<br><br>RTCG assess that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node1\">the employee in question, Shane Jeffries (JEFFRIES), should remain an employee of Ultimate Audio</span>, as the <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node2\">key evidence against him is based on circumstantial factors</span> and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node5\">the catalyst for the investigation is an unattributable accusation with significant intelligence gaps that make it an unreliable and uncredible source</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node8\">Regardless of JEFFRIES' role in corporate espionage, termination of his employment is very likely to result in the MAX10 not being released within the projected timeline.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node11\">This would significantly effect UA's stock price and company value</span>, with <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node16\">financial and reputational ramifications further impacting the company if JEFFRIES is wrongly accused of committing corporate espionage</span>.<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node22\">There are many hypotheses that be can deduced from the vast amount of information provided.</span> However, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node20\">for most of these information sources there are a number of intelligence gaps that reduce the confidence and completeness of any assessment of corporate espionage</span>, including largely:<br><br>&nbsp;

* **<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node48\">Statistically, the probability that JEFFRIES will commit intellectual property theft or corporate espionage is 47.84% due to&nbsp; displaying both scanning and access behaviours within the 'Indicators Check'.</span> **<br>&nbsp; * **<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node53\">It is highly likely that JEFFRIES’ drug test was accurate (negative) with a 6.74% chance that the result produced a false negative.</span>**<br><br>&nbsp; 2. **Background &amp; Fraud Research:**<br><br>2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To consider the espionage threat and broader implications for Ultimate Audio (UA), a background assessment of the main drivers of corporate espionage follows.<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node54\">The motivations for corporate espionage are most commonly money, ideology, coercion or ego.</span><br><br>2.2 _&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**Financial motivatio**_ **n**<br><br>2.2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node55\">Financial motivation, personal gain and organisational, is a primary factor for espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node58\">A stolen piece of developing technology could be worth many millions for a company</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node59\">UA projects earnings from a successful launch of MAX10 to be a $5 million earnings increase.</span><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.2.2&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node62\">Fierce competition is reported in the industry.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node63\">Tzuyu LEE (LEE) the head of Queen Tech Technology desires exceeding competitor developments and be the leader of the sector.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node64\">Queen Tech, NewTekDev and UA, all have significant risk of financial losses if new technology is leaked.</span>&nbsp;<br><br>2.2.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node68\">If espionage is occurring the desired data which will exist in four forms: paper, visual, oral and electronic, and obtained through any of these channels.</span> Therefore, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node67\">security measures employed by UA will alone not protect their company.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node71\">An individual engaging in espionage can obtain the information and transfer it in many ways</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node74\">opportunities to transfer verbally may present themselves to JEFFRIES</span>.<br><br>2.2.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node80\">Personal financial motivation risk factors are present for JEFFRIES.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node84\">There is the availability of a motivated customer for corporate secrets, QueenTech and NewTekDev</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node87\">the reading interest JEFFRIES has in start-ups and enterprise.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node90\">Phone records for JEFFRIES also indicate he has a current financial preoccupation exhibiting unusual behaviour of bank numbers being of most dialled numbers.</span> Alternatively, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node93\">if at present JEFFRIES is establishing his own enterprise</span>, (indicated by <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node94\">his researching entrepreneurs start up and visual cryptography, watermarking, and steganography</span>), then <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node97\">frequent calls to his bank are plausible</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node102\">The books also have an author with the same surname</span>, therefore <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node103\">he may have a contact with that name, hence the interest in those particular books</span>.<br><br>2.2.5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node109\">Espionage is more likely in an environment of wealth, and an important driver is envy towards those with wealth.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node112\">JEFFRIES resides in Kingston, considered a contemporary, modern in the top 10 highest socioeconomic suburb of Canberra.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node113\">JEFFRIES may have an image he wishes to create or uphold, driving the desire for financial incentives.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node116\">JEFFRIES has been noted working long hours, which may be due to wanting higher wages, rather than opportunities for espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node119\">Brian Diaz (DIAZ) has expressed his desire of material things in a car, with the same photo captioned by JEFFRIES.</span><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>2.3 _&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ideology, philosophies and belief_<br><br>2.3.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node126\">Contributing to increased occurrence of espionage is decreased employee loyalty and a phenomenon of job-hopping.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node127\">JEFFRIES has demonstrated such behaviour with his employment history.</span> However <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node136\">such behaviour can be attributed to the fact that one employment was an internship and JEFFRIES is under 30 years of age.</span> In addition, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node140\">JEFFRIES has been in the same employment for 3 years, reported to be hardworking by his previous employer and current manager states he is dedicated</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node147\">A more poignant point regarding loyalty is JEFFRIES' call register and his frequent communication with Peyton Winger (WINGER)</span>, although <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node150\">in this context it is unsubstantiated to be indicating connection with espionage</span>.<br><br>2.3.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node153\">More indicative of a threat of espionage is low company loyalty coupled with additional individual and organisational factors.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node154\">The person situation interactionist approach demonstrates the interaction between individual factors (such as morality, locus of control, ego strength, field experience etc.) and situational factors within organisations (such as trust, reinforcement, obedience to authority, responsibility for actions, role taking etc.) as a predictor of espionage.</span><br><br>2.3.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node157\">JEFFRIES requested advice from HR regarding inappropriate comments</span>, and it appears <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node158\">he didn’t receive a reply</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node159\">Such an event creates a high risk situation if other factors are also in place, due to personal vendettas, individual levels of moral development and perceptions of organisational reward and punishment</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node164\">A week later, office conversation overheard regarding JEFFRIES working odd hours.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node165\">This claim was not backed with further information indicating unethical behaviour, and may be due to employee jealously and trying to outdo JEFFRIES who is viewed as achieving new developments and valuable employee.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node168\">The timing of an anonymous complaint of JEFFRIES working suspiciously being received a week later does not add circumstantial credibility to the claims.</span><br><br>2.3.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node173\">The bad barrel approach must be assessed here as it suggests that organisational and societal factors take precedence in explaining unethical behaviour.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node174\">The research suggests that organisational factors such as leadership, reward systems, codes of conduct and norms and culture can significantly influence the likelihood of unethical behaviour.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node177\">If JEFFRIES holds a grievance against the perpetrators of alleged harassment or the company for inaction</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node178\">the absence of trust in the organisational environment can contribute to the creation of untrustworthy work practices</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node181\">JEFFRIES mentioned names, Paul Gertrude and James Bourne (BOURNE), in the email altering HR to the behaviour, which increases the indicated strength of accuracy in the allegations.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node182\">He has also indicated he is challenged by unkind people.</span><br><br>2.3.5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node189\">The “distrust breeds distrust and ultimately betrayal” is illustrated as a cycle; manager observes employee action, manager forms assumption, manager takes protective action, employee observes managers action, employee forms assumption, employee takes protective action, managers negative assumptions are reinforced.</span><br><br>2.3.6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this way, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node192\">the controlling measures undertaken by UA could exacerbate the distrusting elements in the organisation and create further distrust.</span> In addition, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node195\">computer monitored employees, a measure undertaken in UA, suffer to a greater level stress, health and morale problems.</span><br><br>2.3.7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node199\">These factors may increase the risk of espionage conducted by JEFFRIES</span>, however <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node210\">unsupported by other equally weighted factors.</span><br><br>2.4 _&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Coercion and cooperation_<br><br>2.4.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node213\">Individuals who have unmet goals are more likely to engage in unethical behaviours regardless of economic incentives.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node214\">Information indicates JEFFRIES has goals, with an interest in entrepreneurships and conventions.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node215\">In addition to his academic achievements and age, JEFFRIES may be under family pressure to perform.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node216\">He may also have high expectations on himself.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node217\">If the individual is just short of achieving goals the likelihood to espionage is intensified, which may be relevant in JEFFRIES case</span>, however <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node218\">without further personal information this is able to be substantiated</span>.<br><br>2.4.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node221\">Recruitment is an essential component to enable espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node222\">JEFFRIES is highly regarded employee, high performing and instrumental in developing new technology.</span>&nbsp; If <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node229\">Queen Tech has the desire to develop and recruit JEFFRIES to perform espionage for their benefit</span>, there is <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node230\">employment history and social contact historical factors making the situation viable</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node233\">The relationship between LEE and WINGER could have devised and facilitated JEFFRIES employment projectory for the purpose of gaining UAs technology.</span><br><br>2.4.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node238\">JEFFRIES has ongoing high frequency contact with an individual with high influence in NewTekDev</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node239\">there is no information to date to indicate that there is a relationship between LEE and JEFFRIES</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node244\">LEE has displayed unusual behavioural characteristics which may be evident of ulterior motives, through the interview she provided which unusually diverted to discussion on her renovated apartment.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node247\">This behaviour indicates a relationship between LEE, the interviewer and magazine</span>, which <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node250\">may be insignificant</span>. There is also <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node255\">no information to indicate that the high frequency call contact with WINGER is unusual or sudden</span>.<br><br>2.4.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node258\">The risk of an individual engaging in espionage is raised in group situations where dishonest behaviours are witnessed.</span> Additionally, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node259\">individuals will behave in a selfish, less ethical and dishonest ways if they are psychologically close to someone who engages in unethical acts</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node262\">These factors are not consistent in JEFFRIES situation as he completed internship during a formative age, with Queen Tech who are reported to not tolerate espionage behaviour and view it seriously, and his current workplace associates have worked on high security projects.</span><br><br>2.5 _&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personal characteristics, ego, self-image_<br><br>2.5.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node269\">Regarding personality and characteristics, Machiavellianism is seen as the strongest predictor of unethical intentions in individuals.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node276\">Machiavellianism is a personality trait involving manipulativeness, deceit, cynical views, and cold calculating behaviour.</span> This indicates that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node278\">the level of threat posed by an individual can be identified by analysis of their indicative characteristics and the underlying traits of Machiavellianism which is crucial in espionage behaviour.</span><br><br>2.5.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node291\">Information obtained regarding JEFFRIES personal characteristics do not meet the description of Machiavellianism.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node296\">JEFFRIES is described as friendly, well liked, and holds values of kindness highly.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node299\">JEFFRIES has demonstrated behavioural reliability in similar positions to that which he currently holds establishing the likelihood he is consistent in personal characteristics.</span><br><br>2.5.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node302\">Self-image indicators including location, powerlifting, in-trend dog breeds, young age, influence of social networks, conventions and ‘beautiful’<br>people without correlation with other high risk factors do not provide substantive personal characteristics relevant to the occurrence of espionage.</span> In addition, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node305\">information may indicate that JEFFRIES may be stressed at work or home, and employs unhelpful coping techniques</span>.&nbsp; However <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node308\">alcohol, stress ball, medication without context are unable to reliably indicate such behaviour.</span><br><br>&nbsp; 3. **Intelligence Findings:**<br><br>&nbsp; * 3.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node311\">The activities JEFFRIES has undertaken in the past 4 weeks are assessed as being part of the work required in the lead up to the release of a new product – the MAX10 - and are unlikely as evidence of corporate espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node314\">It is almost certain that JEFFRIES’ activities are due to his relationship with DIAZ and trying to start a family through the surrogacy process.</span>&nbsp;<br><br>3.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Furthermore, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node321\">the assortment of medication and pills found on Shane’s desk are not indicative of illegal drug use</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node319\">All the medications are legal and their use is associated with assisting in fertility problems and healthy pregnancies.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node328\">It is assumed that the two females in DIAZ’s Instagram post about brunch are surrogates for JEFFRIES and DIAZ to start a family.</span> Based on this assumption, the <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node331\">transaction of $9,800 of ‘cover costs’ from JEFFRIES and DIAZ to MJ and SC is possibly for costs associated with this surrogacy process.</span><br><br>3.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node336\">The books on his desk align with the hobbies and interests listed on Shane’s resume.</span><br><br>3.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node339\">The erratic timing of JEFFRIES’ hours at the office are not indicative of corporate espionage, but rather are likely to align with the extra work required towards the end of a large project.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node344\">Intelligence gaps remain whether anyone else in the team is also working erratic hours.</span> That said, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node347\">accessing worksites at unusual times and working more than anticipated are noted as behaviours indicative of fraud.</span><br><br>3.5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Given <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node350\">the hypothesis that JEFFRIES is in a same-sex relationship</span>, and that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node353\">he had raised concerns about homophobic comments that went un-addressed by the company’s HR area</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node354\">an accusation of corporate espionage could be seen as targeted and discriminatory against an individual who identifies as LGBTQI</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node362\">This in turn could lead to significant reputational effects for the company, if it wrongly accuses a LGBTQI employee or corporate espionage, on the basis of very circumstantial evidence.</span><br><br>3.6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node371\">The current nature of JEFFRIES and WINGER’s relationship remains an intelligence gap.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node376\">WINGER’s presence on the list of JEFFRIES' recent calls indicates contact between the two, but the nature of that contact is unknown</span>. As such, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node381\">the relationship between JEFFRIES and WINGER, and the relationship between WINGER and LEE does not support the hypothesis that JEFFRIES is passing corporate information to Queen Tech via WINGER.</span><br><br>3.7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node390\">The reason for the transfer of a $21,900 ‘gift’ from Beige Lawyers to the joint account of JEFFRIES and DIAZ also remains an intelligence gap.</span> Whilst <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node396\">the transfer of such an amount could indicate a payment for JEFFRIES passing on UA’s corporate information to Queen Tech</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node399\">there is no identified connection between Beige Lawyers and Queen Tech</span>.<br><br>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.

The probability that the result we have is a false positive (falsely accused of lying) is 12%.<br><br>The error rate on a given result allows us to infer the extent to which we can be sure that result is accurate.&nbsp; This is why 88% is the correct answer.<br><br>_**Question 2**_ : The probability that probability that Shane has or will perpetrate acts of IP theft or espionage is 97.82%.<br><br>&nbsp; <br>_Reason:&nbsp; _ The question is one of conditional probability - given that Shane has been both scanning and accessing, what is the probability that he is guilty? We can use the formula for conditional probability&nbsp; to attain the following equation, where G= guilty, I =Innocent, S= Scanning and A =<br>Accessing<br><br>**Below image is a placeholder, haven't had time to fully write out an explanation yet**<br><br><img><br><br>_**Question 3**_ : Given that we do not know which model security officers used to test the sample and that Shane's test was negative, the probability that the result is a false negative reading is&nbsp; **15.28%**.<br><br>_Reason:_&nbsp; Our understanding of 'false negative' is when you test negative but are truly positive. A 'true positive' is when you test positive and are truly positive. From Document 14/YY we know the Probability of the test being the Older model is = 0.69 and thus we can infer the Probability of the Updated model is = 0.31. In order to calculate the Probability of Shane's negative test result being a false negative, the following calculations were conducted. First the probability of Shane result being a false negative<br><br>The probability of Shane using an older version of the test and having a false negative is 0.69 * 0.19 (which is 1 - 81, the rate of a true positive)&nbsp; and =<br>0.1311.<br><br>The probability of Shane using an updated version of the test and having a false negative is&nbsp; 0.31 * 0.07 (which is 1 - 93, the rate of a true positive) and = 0.0217.<br><br>We then add these two values together to find the probability of Shane's result being a false negative reading, 0.1311 + 0.0217 = 0.1528. This is a 15.28% probability.<br><br>## Reasoning:<br><br>According to the evidence analysed, the RTCG has come to the conclusion that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node2\">it is likely employee Shane Jeffries was involved in corporate espionage</span>. The following describes detailed reasoning for this conclusion.<br><br>Firstly, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node5\">Mr Jeffries has worked with UA’s direct competitor Queen Tech in an internship role and continued on at Queen Tech in his first job as well.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node11\">This relationship suggests that there could be loyalties or good connections in place from the start.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node16\">Jefferie's has also mentioned how it was an important stepping stone for him and helped him get to where he is now (perhaps even now despite working for UA).</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node19\">Peyton Winger mentioned that Shane’s skills were second to none and did not want him leaving his role</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node20\">the same could have been noticed with his previous workmates and managers at Queen Tech and may have provided him with some incentives for his recent work.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node25\">Shane’s polygraph analysis showcased him failing his polygraph test regarding Question D. Which was 'Is there any reason why you would not maintain the confidentiality and secrecy requirements of a role with UA?' He answered: No.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node26\">This was conducted three years before where he previously also worked on a project for the Department of Defence.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node27\">This could suggest that Shane may have had this planned from as long ago as then.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node40\">This assumption is supported by the Probability calculated in Question 1, where even when taking error into consideration, there is still an 88% chance that his answer to Question D was in fact a lie.</span><br><br>The Interview with Linda Kim could also suggest a few things: <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node43\">Shane often did his own thing and was not overly managed.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node44\">This freedom and lack of supervision could allow him to get away with anything suspicious or incriminating.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node49\">Shane was also integral to the development of MAX10 and without him, the project would fall apart.</span> Thereby, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node50\">Linda may not have given too much weight on the anonymous complaint that was submitted since firing Shane would risk going ahead of the whole project.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node55\">Linda was also not aware of the inconsistencies in Shane’s polygraph</span> and thus this supports <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node56\">why Linda was confident in Shane’s integrity.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node61\">The Lab schematics also showed that Shane was closest to the lockers and the entry/exit of the lab.</span> This could suggest that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node62\">it was possible for him to sneak something in and out of the lab without anyone noticing.</span><br><br>Regarding the time and printer records, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node67\">Shane showcased odd time log activity in the past&nbsp; **two**&nbsp;&nbsp; **weeks** , which correlates to the unusual printing activity in the&nbsp; **past 2 weeks**</span>. Furthermore, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node68\">IT was unable to provide information on what was being printed</span> whereas, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node70\">despite UA security reporting documents included lists of names and some general public information about the company, it could just be encrypted to seem like normal information.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node79\">The bank transactions of a 9,800 as cover costs and 9,800 as cover costs and21,900 labelled as a gift by Beige Lawyers did not make any clear sense.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node80\">These labels were clearly not indicative of the real description.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node83\">This could be a method that Jeffries used as a payment to carry out the espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node86\">Giving money in the form of gifts might be a mask to avoid paying taxes on the funding.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node91\">As well as his all records to ‘unknown mobile numbers’.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node94\">The I.T usage report showcased that Shane had both indicators of scanning and access to malicious activity.</span> ( **Support <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node97\">from probability Question 2</span>).&nbsp; **<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node100\">Possible motivations for corporate espionage could include the inappropriate homophobic comments made by his co-workers and no action taken by the HR could have made him disappointed and mad.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node103\">Evidence correlating to that can be Shane’s Instagram posts in the past&nbsp; **2 weeks</span>;&nbsp; **<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node106\">The convention could suggest meeting new people who took an interest in his work, the ‘needed this’ and ‘be nice to people’ could be referred to his frustrations in his work environment</span> and lastly, how did he afford such an expensive car?<br><br>More evidence corroborating Shane’s suspicious behaviour could be through <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node113\">the items found in the security spot check which included books on ‘How to Start a Startup: The Silicon Valley Playbook for Entrepreneurs’, ‘Ultrasonic Transducers: Materials and Design for Sensors, Actuators and Medical Applications’, and a ‘Handbook of Image-based Security Techniques’</span>. Which could suggest <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node114\">his motivations on how to safely steal information and why he wants to</span>.<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node119\">Brian’s Instagram posts before getting the car also seemed like he was struggling at work</span>, maybe they needed a way out?<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node122\">The Protector news article showcased that key developing technology could be worth $10s of millions, which could be great incentives.</span><br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node125\">There could be a possible drug use problem</span> with <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node126\">the probability of&nbsp; a&nbsp; **false negative reading</span> (Support from probability Question 3)**<br><br>### Threat and broader implications for UA:<br><br>If <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node129\">Shane's position at UA is terminated and that impacts upon the release of the MAX10</span>, as <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node130\">document 20/XX</span> indicates, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node133\">there could be a significant financial implication for the company</span>. It is suggested that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node142\">the company could lose up to$7 million in earnings.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node145\">This loss of earning could be just the beginning for the company if Shane really is not involved in any form of espionage and files for wrongful termination.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node149\">Along with this comes a length legal battle and compensation.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node150\">Additionally, this then leaves space for the rival company of Queen Tech to release their new technology and have one up on UA.</span><br><br>## Alternatives:<br><br>&nbsp; 1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node151\">Shane was considering opening a Start-Up</span>:<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node152\">The phone call made from Jeffries phone to the bank could be indicative of him trying to seek funds for the Start-up.</span> However, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node155\">if Jeffries was doing so he would consider using a personal IP.</span><br><br>&nbsp; 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node158\">Jeffries was being harassed</span> considering <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node159\">his complaint to the Hr was true and his email to Kim lee as well</span>. 3. Jeffries and his loyalty with Queen Tech was something that there was not enough evidence for. <br>&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node162\">The Bank Transfer of $21,900 to Brian Diaz could be a method that Jeffries used as a payment to carry out the espionage.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node165\"><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node165\">Giving money in the form of gifts might be a mask to avoid paying taxes on the funding</span>.</span> 5. Considering the complaint letter from Jeffries was untrue, it could also be considered as a mask or distraction to carry out an espionage<br><br>&nbsp; 6. PS: <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node168\">The medication found in Jeffries possession included: (I looked what each of them are used for)paracetamol, ibuprofen, fexofenadine, folic acid, L-carnitine, serophene, panax ginseng and zinc, out of which folic acid, serophene are medicines that are used to treat infertility in women and panax ginseng is for erectile dysfunction.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node169\">The posts on his social media</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node170\">could probably be related to problems that he is facing with his wife sexually, or they are facing problems in having a child.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node176\">The decreased working hours could also be seen as an effort on Jeffries behalf to try and have a child with his wife.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node179\">His social media posts could be indicative of the pressure that his family might be putting on him to have a baby. </span><span class=\"highlighted hlcurrent\" id=\"node184\">This pressure could have in turn increased his drinking.</span><br><br><br>","labclass7b":"<br><br>**Report #1 - Corporate Espionage**<br><br>**Key Judgements&nbsp; **<br><br>Based on <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node1\">an analysis of the information provided on the employee</span>, as well as <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node2\">taking into account calculated probabilities</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node3\">it seems unlikely that Shane Jeffries is currently or will be involved in corporate espionage at Ultimate Audio (UA).</span><br><br>**Probability Tests**<br><br>To help inform our assessment of Shane’s suitability to hold a position at UA we examined the results of a polygraph test and an Indicator’s check.<br><br>First, we looked at Shane’s answers to UA’s polygraph test compulsory for all newly recruited staff members. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node8\">The polygraph test</span> indicated that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node9\">Shane lied on Question D: Is there any reason why you would not maintain the confidentiality and secrecy requirements of a role with UA?</span><br><br>_Q1: What is the probability that Shane lied on Question D during the polygraph?_<br><br>`chance of Lying is 2% `<br><br>`chance of ReportLying given Lying is 88% `<br><br>`chance of ReportLying given not Lying is 12% `<br><br>`% chance of Lying given ReportLying? 13%`<br><br>Results show that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node12\">there was a 13% chance that Shane was actually lying on Question D during the polygraph test</span>.
