(share price)</span><br><br># Reasoning<br><br>There are essentially two pieces of direct \"evidence\" for the hypothesis that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node49\">SJ is engaged in corporate espionage or IP theft</span>.<br><br>&nbsp; 1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node50\">The handwritten note, delivered to HR's mailbox, accusing him of this</span>. 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node57\">His extremely irregular working hours and \"odd\" behaviour over the last 3 weeks.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, we have <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node60\">some ambiguous polygraph evidence</span>; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node71\">inconclusive IT usage records</span>, and <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node74\">\"suspicious\" bank transactions</span>.<br><br>Considering each of these in turn:<br><br>### 1\\. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node79\">The \"tip\" to HR was a malicious act by a team rival, most likely James Bourne</span><br><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node82\">The \"informant\" appears very keen not to be identified -- the note was hand-written and hand-delivered to a physical mailbox. It was also expressed in rather childish terms -- eg. \"giving away all our hard work\"</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node87\">JB also informed on SJ's \"odd hours\" to their manager, and explicitly linked this to his desire to have his (JB's) work receive higher priority</span><br>&nbsp; *&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node90\">When called out for remarks that SJ felt were \"inappropriate\" (homophobic), JB did not respond at all, possibly indicating a deeper level of hostility than casual bigotry or dislike.</span> This contrasts with <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node93\">the conventionally dismissive response given by the other party to the conversation (Paul Gertrude).</span><br><br>### 2.&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node96\">The irregular working hours are a reaction to the interpersonal conflict with co-workers</span><br><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node101\">Up until 3 weeks ago SJ's working hours were entirely regular.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node104\">The timing of his absences in week T-3 would accord with an interstate trip: fly out on Wednesday afternoon; return late on Thursday. The purpose of the absence is unknown; one possibility is to attend a conference, perhaps the conference mentioned in his instagram post about a week later.</span>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node107\">On the Monday of week T-2 he throws himself back into work; not leaving until 11pm.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node110\">The next day he leaves at 3pm; later it is discovered that he sent an email to HR about this time regarding the \"inappropriate\" remarks made by his co-workers.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node113\">On Wednesday he arrives at 5am and leaves at 1pm; supporting the supposition that he is trying to minimize time spent in the lab with the rest of the team. We note that the lab in which they all work seems (from the schematic) rather cramped, thereby increasing the discomfort occasioned by the conflict.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node116\">The rest of week T-2 he seems to be waiting for a response from HR; none was received.</span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node121\">By Week T-1 he has apparently decided enough is enough (ref. the \"enough\" image posted on instagram about this time), and seems to be preparing to leave UA. He comes in for 2 hours on Monday, leaves early on Thursday, isn't seen on Friday; and comes in on the weekend just to do a heap of copying and printing.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node126\">We conjecture that he has always intended at some point to start his own business, and has now decided to advance this plan (ref. the book on Startups, and the StartCon pamphlet).</span><br><br>### 3.&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node129\">The polygraph \"evidence\" is both unreliable and irrelevant.</span><br><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node132\">A very high probability of both false positive and false negatives</span>, combined with <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node135\">the very low incidence of IP theft in the relevant population (2%)</span> implies <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node138\">the machine has only a 13% chance of correctly detecting a lie (based on a single question).</span><br>&nbsp; * We note however, that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node145\">we have only the first 4 questions in what was presumably a longer interview</span>. The first 3 are warmup questions, meant to establish as baseline for truthful responses and allow the subject to relax. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node148\">The 4th question is one to which there is only 1 acceptable response (\"No\"), yet any person with an imagination would have to answer \"yes\" if they were being completely truthful. It is possible that this was actually a control question --- ref.

The evidence for the surrogacy arrangement is highly circumstantial; largely resting on the supposition(1) that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node169\">SJ is in a stable long-term relationship with his partner (Brian Diaz)</span>, yet is <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node172\">apparently taking a cocktail of medications related to male infertility</span>(2). We also note <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node175\">BD's recent post regarding brunch with \"these beautiful people\"; referring to a female couple who might be \"MJ and SC\"</span>. 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node178\">The $9,800 transfer to \"MJ and SC\" to \"cover costs\" is then for the additional insurance cover to cover the `gap' in normal health insurance. This doesn't cover IVF and is usually around \\$9-14K in Australia.</span> 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node181\">GIFT or [Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer] is an IVF procedure that involves fertilisation of an egg with sperm from a donor. The cost of this treatment in Australia is around \\$20,000</span>(3)<br><br>(1)Supported by the fact that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node184\">SJ &amp; BD have a joint back account</span><br><br>(2)<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node187\">As found in the Security check of SJ's workdesk.</span><br><br>(3)<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node190\">This does require a somewhat roundabout transaction chain to account for the inconsistent direction of the transfer</span> --see Fig.1 below<br><br><img><br><br>Fig,1 Legal/financial arrangements for GIFT/surrogacy<br><br>## Contending hypotheses<br><br>### 1\\. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node194\">SJ is engaged in IP theft</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node195\">motivated largely by unhappiness with his treatment by UA</span><br><br>The argument here follows from that outlined above, except <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node198\">SJ is now focused on launching his own company, and, feeling no particular loyalty to UA because he feels mistreated, is actively taking steps to maximize his chance of success by stealing work currently under development, either in the expectation of being able to further develop it himself, or to sell to a 3rd party</span>. In this scenario&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node201\">the book on visual cryptography&nbsp; was acquired for this purpose</span>. A possible scheme might work as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; 1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node204\">SJ brings his phone to work, as usual, with some photos on it. The phone goes into the locker on the outside wall of the lab. It is not switched off. 2. The&nbsp; phone locker happens to be on the other side of the wall from SJ's desk; unless the lab has been setup as a Faraday cage it would be possible for SJ to connect to the phone from his workstation; download the photos from it; add the encryption layer, and send them back to the phone.</span> 3. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node212\">If the room is a Faraday cage he would need to breach it; the feasibility of this depends on the nature of the wall.</span><br><br>**Counter-argument:**&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node215\">if SJ had in fact decided to help himself to the team's work, surely he would not be acting in such a way as to bring negative attention on himself while he did it.<br></span><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node218\">If SJ _was_ engaged in IP theft then the question of whether the \"3rd party\" is in fact Queen Tech (QT) becomes relevant.</span> Here we note that<br><br>&nbsp; 1. SJ is on very good terms with Peyton Winger, his former boss at NewTekDev (NDT) 2. Peyton Winger is married to Tzuyu Lee, the head of technology development at QT 3. Tzuyu Lee has very recently claimed to be certain of \"matching and exceeding \" whatever their competitors put forward. 4. SJ and his partner Brian Diaz have recently received $21,900 labelled \"GIFT\" from an unknown source using a legal firm as an intermediary.<br><br>Supporting evidence for the \"Startup\" hypothesis&nbsp; is <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node219\">the possession of ‘How to Start a Startup: The Silicon Valley Playbook for Entrepreneurs’&nbsp; and a StartCon 2020 brochure.</span> A potential counterargument is <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node222\">the purchase of the car; while not wildly expensive (the car is a Hyundai i30 N-line), he would surely want to preserve as much capital as he can, if only for contingencies.<br></span><br>### 2\\. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node225\">SJ is not engaged in IP theft, but has let it be known that he is leaving UA</span><br><br>The impact here could be just as serious, because it's immediate. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node226\">If Linda Kim is right, and the MAX10 launch depends crucially on SJ's input</span>, then <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node227\">it will fail if he leaves beforehand (the launch is in 3 weeks)</span>. In this scenario, SJ lets PW know of his problems at UA; perhaps in return for a modest consideration, with the result that TL knows that UA will likely not have a product to present at the SOUND Forum.<br><br>## Key assumptions<br><br>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node230\">That SJ's atypical behaviour of the last few weeks is indicative of a man in turmoil, not a singularly reckless thief.</span><br><br>## Key unknowns<br><br>&nbsp; 1. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node241\">Where was SJ on the days in week T-3 and T-1 when he was absent from work?</span>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 2. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node244\">Why has there been no review of the secure lab's network and server logs for the most recent 3 weeks?</span><br><br>## Impact on UA's viability<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node247\">The UA Finance Dept. have produced a pair of projections for the next year.<br><br>&nbsp; 1. The MAX10 launch is successful: earnings increase 50%; the share price increases 10%<br>&nbsp; 2. The MAX10 launch is not successful: earnings fall 20%; the share price falls 10%</span><br><br>Accordingly, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node250\">if Linda Kim is correct, and the MAX10 is certain to fail if SJ resigns or is dismissed</span>, then the situation seems clear: <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node253\">every effort must now be made to persuade SJ that he does indeed have a future at UA, and his concerns will be addressed.</span><br><br>While <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node261\">LK is SJ's line manager</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node258\">she seems to be doubling as the project manager; if so we can assume she knows what she's talking about</span>. On the other hand, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node264\">she has apparently missed the growing dysfunction and disaffection in her team, and is perhaps overstating the case</span>.<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node267\">If we assign a credibility of 70% to LK's assessment in this regard, and assign a possibly generous 80% to the probability that the MAX10 will succeed if SJ doesn't leave(1), we can compute the expected earnings and share price for the next year under the 2 scenarios \"SJ leaves\", and \"SJ stays\". Under these assumptions the difference in earnings between the two&nbsp; cases is less than \\$4,000,000;</span> naturally, the lower the value we assign to LK's credibility, the smaller this becomes. See the calculations in the relevant section of the Appendix.<br><br>(1)this is primarily to illustrate the argument; UA must have done an assessment that would suggest a value for this probability; however it has not been provided to RTCG.<br><br># Appendix<br><br>## Probability calculations<br><br>PQ1.&nbsp; What is the probability that SJ lied on Question D?<br><br>&nbsp; * Let D= \"Shane Jeffries lied when he answered Question D\"; and B= \"failed polygraph test\".
