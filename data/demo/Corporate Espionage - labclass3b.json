audio/headphone technology” - Peyton Winger; Manager at NewTekDev </span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node43\">Linda Kim Shane’s line manager described Shane as her best employee. </span><br>&nbsp; * <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node46\">Shane was very friendly with her and the rest of the team. </span><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node49\">Linda Kim said she did not need to overly manage Shane as he often did his own thing and could be trusted to pursue a project. </span><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node52\">Kim said Shane was dedicated to the work and the company.</span><br><br>**Polygraph analysis**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node61\">UA requires that all employees that work in the security division undertake a polygraph during the recruitment process then every five years once employed.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node62\">After the test asked Shane a series of very simple questions to test the answer of the machine</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node63\">it showed that Shane lied on the question \"Is there any reason why you would not maintain the confidentiality and secrecy requirements of a role with UA?\"</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node64\">Taking into account the amount this polygraph fails, the probability that this lie was a true positive is&nbsp; **88%**.</span> However, although <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node65\">this appears incriminating</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node70\">this question is ambiguous and stress-inducing, especially in comparison to the very straightforward previous questions</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node75\">We need to consider this probability in context of what that means for Shane actually being a perpetrator of corporate espionage.</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node80\">Given statistic that 2%of participants are involved in insider IP theft or espionage and lie on their polygraph we can calculate the probability that Shane is a corporate spy and lied on his polygraph is 13.15%.</span> This is not negligible, and these statistics together definitely warrant interest, however its worth noting that for the purposes of this analysis, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node83\">13.15% is a much more meaningful statistic than looking at lying behaviour on the polygraph alone</span>.<br><br>**HR reports and co-worker disputes**<br><br>Note the following reports/emails indicating <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node86\">turmoil with Shane and co-<br>workers;</span><br><br>**_Two weeks ago_**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node89\">Email from Shane to HR; Informing them that Paul Gertrude and James Bourne made inappropriate homophobic comments and that he confronted them about it to no avail.</span><br><br>**_Last week_**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node92\">Email from James Bourne (co-worker) to Linda Kim (line manager); James cites another team member telling a third colleague that she had seen Shane working odd hours and was suspicious. He asks that because of this his projects should be prioritised over Shane’s.</span><br><br>**_3 days ago_**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node96\">Anonymous email to HR; claiming that they are certain that Shane is working for Queen Tech and stealing technology.</span><br><br>It is interesting to note that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node99\">the complaint from Shane precedes the other two emails</span> and that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node100\">it was never replied to or acknowledged by HR</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node101\">Shane states in the email that he was going to try to avoid those co-workers</span>, but <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node104\">the possibility that this escalated into a feud cannot be ignored</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node107\">Given their shared address, bank accounts, social media posts, etc.</span> it is assumed that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node108\">Shane is in a relationship with Brian Diaz</span> and therefore <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node111\">was personally offended by these comments.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node118\">If these staff members hold homophobic views</span> it could indicate that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node119\">Paul Gertrude and James Bourne take issue with Shane on a personal level</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node122\">It is also worth noting that Shane has no history of disputes with co-workers from this or previous workplaces.</span><br><br>**Time logs and printer records**<br><br>Looking at <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node125\">the scanning and access behaviours associated with perpetrators of insider theft or espionage according to audio technology industry standards and Shane’s IT usage report</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node126\">the probability that he committed theft through scanning and access is&nbsp; **45%**</span>. This is a substantial probability however <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node129\">this was based on the probability that Jeffries lied on question D as the probability Jeffries will commit theft</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node132\">The framing of question D was ambiguous enough to discredit the hypothesis that the probability associated with lying reflects the probability one will actually commit theft.</span> Therefore <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node135\">we may consider a lower probability than 45% as the actual probability Jeffries committed theft via these behaviours</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node142\">which makes keeping him onboard much more favourable</span>.<br><br>Looking at <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node147\">the time logs and printer records provided by UA</span>, there is no question that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node148\">in the last 3 weeks Shane has begun working much more irregular hours</span>. It is also concerning that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node151\">his printing and scanning activity is higher on those days where he is likely to be working with less or no other people in the office</span> (Average 2.26 documents when working regular hours, average 5.66 when working outside these hours). However, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node156\">this could also be explained by Shane avoiding his co-workers</span>, which <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node159\">he has explicitly stated in his email to HR that he was doing</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node162\">Changes in work hours could also be explained by a multitude of reasons relating to Shane’s personal life.</span><br><br>**Connection to Queen Tech and NewTekDev**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node176\">Shane’s connection to Queen Tech is undeniable.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node172\">Having been previously employed at Queen Tech and also at the NewTekDev which is owned by the husband of the owner of Queen Tech, it seems Shane has strong ties there.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node181\">He also had a glowing reference from Peyton Winger his Manager at NewTekDev. </span>However, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node184\">as reported by Linda Kim, Shane does not hide his affiliation and talks about it openly.</span><br><br>**Drug taking behaviour**<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node187\">Shane tested negative to the companies most recent drug test and to the two previous.</span> <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node188\">Given the reliability of the test and these results, the probability that Shane did consume drugs given that he tested negative is 6.9%</span><br><br>**Conclusion**<br><br>The conclusion and recommendations of this analysis are as follows;<br><br><span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node191\">If Shane is stealing technology and remains employed</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node192\">it hurts the longevity of UA</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node195\">If Shane isn't stealing and is fired or quits due to being falsely accused</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node196\">UA loose almost their current annual company earnings</span>. <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node199\">As stated by Linda Kim, losing Shane would mean UA would not be able to release the MAX10 as projected allowing Queen Tech to capitalise at the upcoming SOUND FORUM.</span> Given that <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node202\">this upcoming convention has such a large financial implication for the company</span>, <span class=\"highlighted\" id=\"node211\">it would be unwise to take action before this</span>. <span class=\"highlighted hlcurrent\" id=\"node216\">Additionally, if there is some corporate espionage taking place between these companies, it seems likely that it will be revealed at SOUND FORUM as Queen Tech as their CEO has claimed “their company will be at the forefront of their field, noting they will both match and exceed what their competitors can put forward”.</span><br><br><br>"}}
