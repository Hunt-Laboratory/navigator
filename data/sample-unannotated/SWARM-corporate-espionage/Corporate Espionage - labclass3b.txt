# **There is moderate reason for suspecting Shane Jeffries of corporate espionage. However, it is in UA's best interests to delay investigate until at least after the release of the MAX10 at the upcoming SOUND FORUM.  **

Listed below is an analysis of the likelihood Shane Jeffries is committing corporate espionage for Queen Tech.  It is our advisement that there is not enough evidence of guilt to investigate Shane, given what UA risks by investigating him.  It has been advised by line manager Linda Kim that termination of Shane’s employment or him quitting due to false accusation would mean UA would not be able to release the MAX10 as projected.

The risk of losing Shane as an employee and allowing Queen Tech to capitalise at the upcoming SOUND FORUM is too substantial with this amount of circumstantial evidence surrounding this situation. Although if Shane was stealing from UA this would significantly damage future technology development and the company’s longevity, the part of this risk attached to the upcoming SOUND FORUM is shared by either investigating him or not. There are several other possibilities to explain the evidence against Shane. They are explored below along with the indicators of his guilt.

**Shane’s work history and employer evaluation**

Before recognising any indicators of Shane’s possible guilt, it is imperative to appreciate his value as an employee. In addition to Shane’s roll in the upcoming project, Shane has displayed in his current and previous jobs that he is both capable and constantly improving. The following quotes provide a small summary.

  * “Shane leveraged his training in sound engineering in a way not seen by others of his age to develop new audio/headphone technology” - Peyton Winger; Manager at NewTekDev 
  * Linda Kim Shane’s line manager described Shane as her best employee. 
  * Shane was very friendly with her and the rest of the team. Linda Kim said she did not need to overly manage Shane as he often did his own thing and could be trusted to pursue a project. Kim said Shane was dedicated to the work and the company.

**Polygraph analysis**

UA requires that all employees that work in the security division undertake a polygraph during the recruitment process then every five years once employed. After the test asked Shane a series of very simple questions to test the answer of the machine, it showed that Shane lied on the question "Is there any reason why you would not maintain the confidentiality and secrecy requirements of a role with UA?". Taking into account the amount this polygraph fails, the probability that this lie was a true positive is  **88%**. However, although this appears incriminating, this question is ambiguous and stress-inducing, especially in comparison to the very straightforward previous questions. We need to consider this probability in context of what that means for Shane actually being a perpetrator of corporate espionage.  Given statistic that 2%
of participants are involved in insider IP theft or espionage and lie on their polygraph we can calculate the probability that Shane is a corporate spy and lied on his polygraph is 13.15%. This is not negligible, and these statistics together definitely warrant interest, however its worth noting that for the purposes of this analysis, 13.15% is a much more meaningful statistic than looking at lying behaviour on the polygraph alone.

**HR reports and co-worker disputes**

Note the following reports/emails indicating turmoil with Shane and co-
workers;

**_Two weeks ago_**

Email from Shane to HR; Informing them that Paul Gertrude and James Bourne made inappropriate homophobic comments and that he confronted them about it to no avail.

**_Last week_**

Email from James Bourne (co-worker) to Linda Kim (line manager); James cites another team member telling a third colleague that she had seen Shane working odd hours and was suspicious. He asks that because of this his projects should be prioritised over Shane’s.

**_3 days ago_**

Anonymous email to HR; claiming that they are certain that Shane is working for Queen Tech and stealing technology.

It is interesting to note that the complaint from Shane precedes the other two emails and that it was never replied to or acknowledged by HR. Shane states in the email that he was going to try to avoid those co-workers, but the possibility that this escalated into a feud cannot be ignored. Given their shared address, bank accounts, social media posts, etc. it is assumed that Shane is in a relationship with Brian Diaz and therefore was personally offended by these comments. If these staff members hold homophobic views it could indicate that Paul Gertrude and James Bourne take issue with Shane on a personal level. It is also worth noting that Shane has no history of disputes with co-workers from this or previous workplaces.

**Time logs and printer records**

Looking at the scanning and access behaviours associated with perpetrators of insider theft or espionage according to audio technology industry standards and Shane’s IT usage report, the probability that he committed theft through scanning and access is  **45%**. This is a substantial probability however this was based on the probability that Jeffries lied on question D as the probability Jeffries will commit theft. The framing of question D was ambiguous enough to discredit the hypothesis that the probability associated with lying reflects the probability one will actually commit theft. Therefore we may consider a lower probability than 45% as the actual probability Jeffries committed theft via these behaviours, which makes keeping him onboard much more favourable.

Looking at the time logs and printer records provided by UA, there is no question that in the last 3 weeks Shane has begun working much more irregular hours. It is also concerning that his printing and scanning activity is higher on those days where he is likely to be working with less or no other people in the office (Average 2.26 documents when working regular hours, average 5.66 when working outside these hours). However, this could also be explained by Shane avoiding his co-workers, which he has explicitly stated in his email to HR that he was doing. Changes in work hours could also be explained by a multitude of reasons relating to Shane’s personal life.

**Connection to Queen Tech and NewTekDev**

Shane’s connection to Queen Tech is undeniable. Having been previously employed at Queen Tech and also at the NewTekDev which is owned by the husband of the owner of Queen Tech, it seems Shane has strong ties there. He also had a glowing reference from Peyton Winger his Manager at NewTekDev. However, as reported by Linda Kim, Shane does not hide his affiliation and talks about it openly.

**Drug taking behaviour**

Shane tested negative to the companies most recent drug test and to the two previous. Given the reliability of the test and these results, the probability that Shane did consume drugs given that he tested negative is 6.9%

**Conclusion**

The conclusion and recommendations of this analysis are as follows;

If Shane is stealing technology and remains employed, it hurts the longevity of UA. If Shane isn't stealing and is fired or quits due to being falsely accused, UA loose almost their current annual company earnings. As stated by Linda Kim, losing Shane would mean UA would not be able to release the MAX10 as projected allowing Queen Tech to capitalise at the upcoming SOUND FORUM. Given that this upcoming convention has such a large financial implication for the company, it would be unwise to take action before this. Additionally, if there is some corporate espionage taking place between these companies, it seems likely that it will be revealed at SOUND FORUM as Queen Tech as their CEO has claimed “their company will be at the forefront of their field, noting they will both match and exceed what their competitors can put forward”.
