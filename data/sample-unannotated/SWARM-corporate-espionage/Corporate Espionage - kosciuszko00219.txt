**Shane Jeffries Assessment of Suitability Report:**

RTCG assess that the employee in question, Shane Jeffries (JEFFRIES), should remain an employee of Ultimate Audio, as the key evidence against him is based on circumstantial factors and the catalyst for the investigation is an unattributable accusation with significant intelligence gaps that make it an unreliable and uncredible source. Regardless of JEFFRIES' role in corporate espionage, termination of his employment is very likely to result in the MAX10 not being released within the projected timeline. This would significantly effect UA's stock price and company value, with financial and reputational ramifications further impacting the company if JEFFRIES is wrongly accused of committing corporate espionage.

There are many hypotheses that be can deduced from the vast amount of information provided. However, for most of these information sources there are a number of intelligence gaps that reduce the confidence and completeness of any assessment of corporate espionage, including largely:

  * timeline of phone calls,
  * content of printed and copied/scanned documents,
  * why a human resource complaint was not actioned,
  * Who are MJ and SC, and who the couple referred to in Brian Diaz's (DIAZ) Instagram post,
  * Who are Beige Lawyers and why did they send $21,900 to DIAZ (and JEFFRIES).

  1. **Key Judgements:**

  * **It is unlikely that JEFFRIES  is committing corporate espionage based on information presented at hand, however due to limited intelligence further investigation is recommended to address intelligence gaps. **
  * **It is highly likely that JEFFRIES  was being truthful during the polygraph test. The probability that JEFFRIES lied on Question D of the polygraph is 13.15%.**
  * **Statistically, the probability that JEFFRIES will commit intellectual property theft or corporate espionage is 47.84% due to  displaying both scanning and access behaviours within the 'Indicators Check'. **
  * **It is highly likely that JEFFRIES’ drug test was accurate (negative) with a 6.74% chance that the result produced a false negative.**

  2. **Background & Fraud Research:**

2.1          To consider the espionage threat and broader implications for Ultimate Audio (UA), a background assessment of the main drivers of corporate espionage follows.

The motivations for corporate espionage are most commonly money, ideology, coercion or ego.

2.2 _           **Financial motivatio**_ **n**

2.2.1      Financial motivation, personal gain and organisational, is a primary factor for espionage. A stolen piece of developing technology could be worth many millions for a company, and UA projects earnings from a successful launch of MAX10 to be a $5 million earnings increase.

            2.2.2    Fierce competition is reported in the industry. Tzuyu LEE (LEE) the head of Queen Tech Technology desires exceeding competitor developments and be the leader of the sector. Queen Tech, NewTekDev and UA, all have significant risk of financial losses if new technology is leaked. 

2.2.3      If espionage is occurring the desired data which will exist in four forms: paper, visual, oral and electronic, and obtained through any of these channels. Therefore, security measures employed by UA will alone not protect their company. An individual engaging in espionage can obtain the information and transfer it in many ways, and opportunities to transfer verbally may present themselves to JEFFRIES.

2.2.4      Personal financial motivation risk factors are present for JEFFRIES. There is the availability of a motivated customer for corporate secrets, QueenTech and NewTekDev, and the reading interest JEFFRIES has in start-ups and enterprise. Phone records for JEFFRIES also indicate he has a current financial preoccupation exhibiting unusual behaviour of bank numbers being of most dialled numbers. Alternatively, if at present JEFFRIES is establishing his own enterprise, (indicated by his researching entrepreneurs start up and visual cryptography, watermarking, and steganography), then frequent calls to his bank are plausible. The books also have an author with the same surname, therefore he may have a contact with that name, hence the interest in those particular books.

2.2.5      Espionage is more likely in an environment of wealth, and an important driver is envy towards those with wealth. JEFFRIES resides in Kingston, considered a contemporary, modern in the top 10 highest socioeconomic suburb of Canberra.  JEFFRIES may have an image he wishes to create or uphold, driving the desire for financial incentives. JEFFRIES has been noted working long hours, which may be due to wanting higher wages, rather than opportunities for espionage. Brian Diaz (DIAZ) has expressed his desire of material things in a car, with the same photo captioned by JEFFRIES.

  

2.3 _          Ideology, philosophies and belief_

2.3.1     Contributing to increased occurrence of espionage is decreased employee loyalty and a phenomenon of job-hopping. JEFFRIES has demonstrated such behaviour with his employment history. However such behaviour can be attributed to the fact that one employment was an internship and JEFFRIES is under 30 years of age. In addition, JEFFRIES has been in the same employment for 3 years, reported to be hardworking by his previous employer and current manager states he is dedicated. A more poignant point regarding loyalty is JEFFRIES' call register and his frequent communication with Peyton Winger (WINGER), although in this context it is unsubstantiated to be indicating connection with espionage.

2.3.2     More indicative of a threat of espionage is low company loyalty coupled with additional individual and organisational factors. The person situation interactionist approach demonstrates the interaction between individual factors (such as morality, locus of control, ego strength, field experience etc.) and situational factors within organisations (such as trust, reinforcement, obedience to authority, responsibility for actions, role taking etc.) as a predictor of espionage.

2.3.3     JEFFRIES requested advice from HR regarding inappropriate comments, and it appears he didn’t receive a reply. Such an event creates a high risk situation if other factors are also in place, due to personal vendettas, individual levels of moral development and perceptions of organisational reward and punishment. A week later, office conversation overheard regarding JEFFRIES working odd hours. This claim was not backed with further information indicating unethical behaviour, and may be due to employee jealously and trying to outdo JEFFRIES who is viewed as achieving new developments and valuable employee.  The timing of an anonymous complaint of JEFFRIES working suspiciously being received a week later does not add circumstantial credibility to the claims.

2.3.4     The bad barrel approach must be assessed here as it suggests that organisational and societal factors take precedence in explaining unethical behaviour. The research suggests that organisational factors such as leadership, reward systems, codes of conduct and norms and culture can significantly influence the likelihood of unethical behaviour. If JEFFRIES holds a grievance against the perpetrators of alleged harassment or the company for inaction the absence of trust in the organisational environment can contribute to the creation of untrustworthy work practices. JEFFRIES mentioned names, Paul Gertrude and James Bourne (BOURNE), in the email altering HR to the behaviour, which increases the indicated strength of accuracy in the allegations. He has also indicated he is challenged by unkind people.

2.3.5     The “distrust breeds distrust and ultimately betrayal” is illustrated as a cycle; manager observes employee action, manager forms assumption, manager takes protective action, employee observes managers action, employee forms assumption, employee takes protective action, managers negative assumptions are reinforced.

2.3.6     In this way, the controlling measures undertaken by UA could exacerbate the distrusting elements in the organisation and create further distrust. In addition, computer monitored employees, a measure undertaken in UA, suffer to a greater level stress, health and morale problems.

2.3.7     These factors may increase the risk of espionage conducted by JEFFRIES, however unsupported by other equally weighted factors.

2.4 _          Coercion and cooperation_

2.4.1     Individuals who have unmet goals are more likely to engage in unethical behaviours regardless of economic incentives. Information indicates JEFFRIES has goals, with an interest in entrepreneurships and conventions. In addition to his academic achievements and age, JEFFRIES may be under family pressure to perform. He may also have high expectations on himself. If the individual is just short of achieving goals the likelihood to espionage is intensified, which may be relevant in JEFFRIES case, however without further personal information this is able to be substantiated.

2.4.2     Recruitment is an essential component to enable espionage. JEFFRIES is highly regarded employee, high performing and instrumental in developing new technology.  If Queen Tech has the desire to develop and recruit JEFFRIES to perform espionage for their benefit, there is employment history and social contact historical factors making the situation viable. The relationship between LEE and WINGER could have devised and facilitated JEFFRIES employment projectory for the purpose of gaining UAs technology.

2.4.3     Although JEFFRIES has ongoing high frequency contact with an individual with high influence in NewTekDev, there is no information to date to indicate that there is a relationship between LEE and JEFFRIES. LEE has displayed unusual behavioural characteristics which may be evident of ulterior motives, through the interview she provided which unusually diverted to discussion on her renovated apartment. This behaviour indicates a relationship between LEE, the interviewer and magazine, which may be insignificant. There is also no information to indicate that the high frequency call contact with WINGER is unusual or sudden.

2.4.4     The risk of an individual engaging in espionage is raised in group situations where dishonest behaviours are witnessed. Additionally, individuals will behave in a selfish, less ethical and dishonest ways if they are psychologically close to someone who engages in unethical acts. These factors are not consistent in JEFFRIES situation as he completed internship during a formative age, with Queen Tech who are reported to not tolerate espionage behaviour and view it seriously, and his current workplace associates have worked on high security projects.

2.5 _          Personal characteristics, ego, self-image_

2.5.1     Regarding personality and characteristics, Machiavellianism is seen as the strongest predictor of unethical intentions in individuals. Machiavellianism is a personality trait involving manipulativeness, deceit, cynical views, and cold calculating behaviour. This indicates that the level of threat posed by an individual can be identified by analysis of their indicative characteristics and the underlying traits of Machiavellianism which is crucial in espionage behaviour.

2.5.2     Information obtained regarding JEFFRIES personal characteristics do not meet the description of Machiavellianism. JEFFRIES is described as friendly, well liked, and holds values of kindness highly. JEFFRIES has demonstrated behavioural reliability in similar positions to that which he currently holds establishing the likelihood he is consistent in personal characteristics.

2.5.3     Self-image indicators including location, powerlifting, in-trend dog breeds, young age, influence of social networks, conventions and ‘beautiful’
people without correlation with other high risk factors do not provide substantive personal characteristics relevant to the occurrence of espionage. In addition, information may indicate that JEFFRIES may be stressed at work or home, and employs unhelpful coping techniques.  However alcohol, stress ball, medication without context are unable to reliably indicate such behaviour.

  3. **Intelligence Findings:**

  * 3.1      The activities JEFFRIES has undertaken in the past 4 weeks are assessed as being part of the work required in the lead up to the release of a new product – the MAX10 - and are unlikely as evidence of corporate espionage. It is almost certain that JEFFRIES’ activities are due to his relationship with DIAZ and trying to start a family through the surrogacy process. 

3.2      Furthermore, the assortment of medication and pills found on Shane’s desk are not indicative of illegal drug use. All the medications are legal and their use is associated with assisting in fertility problems and healthy pregnancies. It is assumed that the two females in DIAZ’s Instagram post about brunch are surrogates for JEFFRIES and DIAZ to start a family. Based on this assumption, the transaction of $9,800 of ‘cover costs’ from JEFFRIES and DIAZ to MJ and SC is possibly for costs associated with this surrogacy process.

3.3      The books on his desk align with the hobbies and interests listed on Shane’s resume.

3.4      The erratic timing of JEFFRIES’ hours at the office are not indicative of corporate espionage, but rather are likely to align with the extra work required towards the end of a large project. Intelligence gaps remain whether anyone else in the team is also working erratic hours. That said, accessing worksites at unusual times and working more than anticipated are noted as behaviours indicative of fraud.

3.5      Given the hypothesis that JEFFRIES is in a same-sex relationship, and that he had raised concerns about homophobic comments that went un-addressed by the company’s HR area, an accusation of corporate espionage could be seen as targeted and discriminatory against an individual who identifies as LGBTQI. This in turn could lead to significant reputational effects for the company, if it wrongly accuses a LGBTQI employee or corporate espionage, on the basis of very circumstantial evidence.

3.6      The current nature of JEFFRIES and WINGER’s relationship remains an intelligence gap. WINGER’s presence on the list of JEFFRIES' recent calls indicates contact between the two, but the nature of that contact is unknown. As such, the relationship between JEFFRIES and WINGER, and the relationship between WINGER and LEE does not support the hypothesis that JEFFRIES is passing corporate information to Queen Tech via WINGER.

3.7      The reason for the transfer of a $21,900 ‘gift’ from Beige Lawyers to the joint account of JEFFRIES and DIAZ also remains an intelligence gap. Whilst the transfer of such an amount could indicate a payment for JEFFRIES passing on UA’s corporate information to Queen Tech, there is no identified connection between Beige Lawyers and Queen Tech.

**4.            Intelligence Gaps**

The following intelligence gaps have been noted as critical to the assessment:

  * The working hours of other employees at UA. Does anyone else also work outside normal operating hours. 
  * The transfer of $21,900.00 from Beige Lawyers marked as ‘gift’.
  * No psychological assessment has been conducted on JEFFRIES. 
  * The writer of the anonymous accusation against JEFFRIES. 
  * The specific event or incident the tip-off mentions as 'confirming' suspicions.
  * Is the laboratory sterile and block all wireless communication or connection (such as Bluetooth) from outside. 
  * Lack of print records, was JEFFRIES printing off work-related material or HR policy material during his weekend attendance. 
  * The timeline and call log of phone records from JEFFRIES work desk.
  * The owners of the mobile numbers in JEFFRIES call history.
  * Who MJ and SC are, and who the couple in DIAZ's Instagram post are.

**5.           Appendices: (charts and reference material)**

**Appendix A: Probability Assessments.**

**Q1: According to the polygraph results, what is the percentage (%) probability that Shane Jeffries lied on question D during the polygraph?**

Note: The term _thief_ is used below as shorthand for “ _involved in insider theft or corporate espionage_ ”.

**Extrapolation**

The polygraph reported that Shane lied on question D. There are two possibilities:

  1. The polygraph has identified a thief: 89% of 2% = **1.78** % of all polygraph participants. Or;  

  2. The polygraph has made a false accusation: 12% of 98% = **11.76** % of all polygraph participants.

Combining these two percentages, the polygraph reports **13.54** % of participants as lying on question D.

The percentage of reported liars who are thieves is:

_<IMAGE>_

The probability that Shane Jefferies lied on question D during the polygraph is **13.15** %

**Q2: Given the findings of the ‘Indicators Check’, and assuming an initial probability of theft equivalent to the probability that Shane lied on the polygraph, what is the probability that Shane has or will perpetrate acts of IP theft or espionage?**

Extrapolation

Drawing on the probability assessment from the polygraph 13.15% that Shane is a perpetrator; a probability table with all combinations

**Q3: Given that we do not know which model Security Officers used to test the sample and that Shane’s test was negative, what is the probability that the result is a false negative reading?**

  
**Extrapolation**

As an approximation of whether the sample Shane provided was positive or negative, statistics cited in doc. 14/YY were used, which state that for the age group that Shane is in (20 – 29), **28%** had illicitly used drugs in the past 12 months.

Intelligence gap: It is unknown how long since drugs are consumed that they be detected by DD3. In the absence of this information, the following assumption was made: the drug test can detect drugs up to **12 months** after consumed
**.** Applying the 28% figure, the below table was generated, weighted for the likelihood of a positive and negative samples:

Of all outcomes, the probability of a false negative is **4.26%**. However, we are only concerned with the probability of _Shane’s result_ being a false negative. Knowing that Shane’s result is either a true or false negative, so we must calculate the percentage of _all negatives_ that are _false negatives_
