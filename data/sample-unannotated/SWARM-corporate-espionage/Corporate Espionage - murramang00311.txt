**Key judgements:**

  * There is no compelling evidence to suggest Shane Jeffries is committing insider theft.  Our analysis of the UA evidence shows a motivated individual who works well under limited supervision, but whose personal circumstances may indicate possible vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the future.
  * The key physical detection test results—a pre-employment polygraph result, a recent access/scanning report, and random drug test(s)—indicate a low probability that Shane Jeffries is lying or committing corporate espionage. 
  * Additional physical evidence, including access hours, IT usage, printing/scanning, desk check, social media posts, and copies of emails sent to HR, provide important context for assessing Mr Jeffries’ behaviours and likelihood to be committing corporate espionage.
  * We observed some signs of weaknesses in overall corporate culture, shown through the language and content of the anonymous email to HR, social media posts by Mr Jeffries and his partner Brian Diaz. This, coupled with some evidence of Mr Jeffries being under considerable personal stress (which we address in more detail below), may represent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by competitor interests.
  * The key 'red flags' for our assessment include: unexplained large financial transactions in the joint account held by Mr Jeffries and Mr Diaz; allegations from other staff and alleged homophobic comments from Mr Jeffries team mates; Mr Jeffries IT scanning and access behaviour; and some possible undeclared changes in circumstances (the evidence points to a possibility that Mr Jeffries and Mr Diaz may be seeking to start a family through IVF surrogacy means).
  * Some of the evidence pre-dates Mr Jeffries commencing with UA; we assume that UA was not concerned by issues such as the polygraph results to find him unsuitable for employment, nor were any flags raised to warrant more intensive investigation or surveillance. 
  * Given we have assessed the probability of Mr Jeffries being an insider threat as low, we see no case for commencing an overt investigation targeted at him. However, we do see value in initiating more general improvements to the security environment/culture at UA to mitigate any residual risk.

**_Recommendations:_**

  * We recommend immediate action be taken in partnership with the HR department to better characterise weaknesses in corporate culture and develop suitable actions to address these. 
  * We also make recommendations to improve physical and information security to serve as a significant deterrence against future attempts or opportunities for staff to become involved in corporate espionage.

**REASONING**

We decided that a Bayesian network approach—a graphical model of uncertainty—was well suited to the problem because it allows new evidence to be admitted into consideration and prior probability beliefs to be updated in light of that new evidence. This allowed the team to work through the evidence in a systematic manner, from the obvious quantitative physical evidence through to the more subtle psychosocial picture presented by the evidence when taken as a whole.

**Approach**

  * Bayesian probability for physical detection mechanisms
  * Systematic evidence review
  * Psychosocial contextual assessment

**Data**

  * Key data categories we relied on included:
    * Probability assessments of: lying on polygraph pre-employment check; insider theft based on IT access and scanning behaviour; and false negative results on a routine random drug test. For this latter test, we also note that Mr Jeffries had returned negative results for two previous tests in the last 12 months.
    * Other documentary evidence from UA, including employment checks/references; manager statement; desk audit; 
  * See Appendix 1 for further details of evidence which served as our data.

**Results of probability assessments - summary calculations**

1\. What is the probability that Shane was actually lying on his pre-
employment polygraph?

  | Polygraph Shows Lie | Polygraph Show Truth  
---|---|---  
Telling the Truth (98%) | 12% | 88%  
Lying (2%) | 89% | 11%  
  

**Result:** The probability Shane Jeffries was actually lying =
(0.02x0.89)/((0.98x0.12)+(0.02x0.89)) **= 13%**

2\. What is the probability that Shane is committing insider theft based on his IT access and scanning behaviour.

(A) | (B) Scan Behaviour | (C) Access Behaviour | Both Behaviour (AxBXC)  
---|---|---|---  
Espionage Perpetrator (13%) | 63% | 81% | 6.63%  
Rule Abiding (87%) | 33% | 25% | 7.1%  
  

**Result:  **Probability that Shane Jeffries, IT scanning and access behaviour in conjunction with his lie detector probability,  is likely to enact espionage = 0.0663/(0.0663+0.0718) **= 48%**

3.

DD3-O 69%

DD3-U 31%

| DD3-O true negative | DD3-O false negative | DD3-U true negative | DD3-U false negative  
---|---|---|---|---  
Drug user (28%) |   | 19% |   | 7%  
Not drug user (72%) | 77% |   | 91% |  
  

**Result:** Probability that Shane Jeffries is an illegal drug user =

(0.28*0.19*69+0.28*0.07*31)/((0.28*0.19*69)+(0.72*0.77*69)+(0.28*0.07*31)+(0.72*0.94*31))

**=  6.7%**

[An alternative approach to this third probability question was considered, based on the fact that this is the third negative test in 12 months and noting that the prior probability is 28 % in a 12 month period. It might be feasible to consider a sequence of calculations (rather like a second and third opinion when dealing with medical tests and probabilities). In this latter approach, the posterior probability for the first calculation would then be applied as a prior probability for the next calculation and so on. With three rounds of calculation, the probability that Shane Jeffries is a drug user reduces to
<1%.]

**Regardless of which calculation method is used, the probability that Mr Jeffries is an illegal drug user is very low to negligible (between 1.0-6.7%).**

_**Supporting arguments**_

  * What did the evidence suggest to us (review the argument mapping table)
    * drugs/medication found at SJ's desk: the drugs are consistent with someone who's into body building and health. The main item of contention is the serophene drug which provides the basis for two alternative narratives (see below).
  * Relationships (see appendix 2 for diagram). 
    * Clear evidence that Shane and Brian are a domestic couple, as demonstrated by shared address; next of kin nomination to UA HR; shared bank account; new car (appears to be jointly owned); 
    * Known connections between Shane Jeffries and other tech companies, both as a previous employee and recent contact with Peyton Winger at NewTekDev (NTD). Possibilities: seeking advice for StartUp, dog breed information, PW luring SJ back to NTD.
  * Evidence for stress: medications (panax ginseng); stress ball (but could have been a conference giveaway); social media posts (the red "enough" hand, indicating potential bullying; comments about 'odd behaviour'; 
  * What ties the physical evidence together? The drugs found in SJ's desk; the unexplained financial transactions; conclusions drawn from social media posts, etc. What "story" do they tell (see below)?
  * Examining the physical evidence with this psychosocial context in mind. 
  * Assessment of HR's actions re the anonymous complaint and lack of action on SJ's emailed request for advice.

_**Alternative narratives**_

  * Shane and Brian are hoping to become parents through an IVF surrogacy procedure. While Shane is relatively young compared to population averages for gay fatherhood, we don't know how old Brian is.  Brian might be considerably older than Shane and therefore keen to start sooner rather than later.
  * Shane is helping a lesbian couple become pregnant by donating sperm. This would explain money coming IN to the joint account, although the amount of that transfer is considerably higher than the cost of sperm through regulated sperm banks.
  * Shane is focused on his business future, is not motivated by family concerns, but by personal presentation and obtaining support for a new business venture.  In this instance the presence of serophene may be an indicator of earlier anabolic steroid use, which may also serve as explanation for Mr Jeffries' observed behaviour anomalies.

_**Evaluation of information and sources:  **_

The credibility and weight given to various piece of evidence and sources is summarised in Appendix 1.

_**Objections & rebuttals:**_

  * Shane Jeffries' age and lifestage - in isolation would be unlikely to consider parenthood as part of a gay couple. However, we don't know Brian's age and this could be a factor that he is taking into account.

_**Other hypotheses:**_

Two other hypotheses could be developed to fit the available evidence:

  * Mr Jeffries is not committing insider theft, but this line of argument would draw on his ego and ambition. For example, it is possible that he intends to set up his own tech business and allegations of insider theft would militate against this.
  * Mr Jeffries is committing IP theft, but doing so accidentally (or with limited appreciation of his actions). The reasoning behind this hypothesis would revolve around the prime intellectual role he has played in developing MAX10 

_**Key assumptions:  **_

  * We have assumed polygraph assessments are relevant to our consideration. This is not borne out by a quick scan of peer-reviewed/expert literature on the subject. However, for this problem we assume the "process" of undertaking a polygraph test pre-employment signals that UA is "serious about security" and is helpful in creating a desired security culture. We note the results but we have not overly relied on them.

**_Limitations/key unknowns:_**

  * No information was provided for other UA employees.
  * Location of printer unknown

Shane Jeffries (SJ) background:

  * 26 years old
  * Engineering qualification 
  * Lives with partner Brian Diaz in Kingston, ACT
  * Three years at UA after 13 months of post-uni tech development work.
  * Interests are fitness/body-building, music technology and dogs.

|

A non-remarkable background for someone working in the ACT, where the dominant employer is the Commonwealth Government (either directly) or through contract/outsourcing arrangements.

Arguably, SJ is highly motivated and success-oriented, concerned about his physical presentation.

Pre-employment polygraph:

_Result: 13% probability that lie detected was actually a lie_

It’s difficult to assess the implications of this result, given the overwhelming literature that suggests polygraphs to little better than educated hunches

Given the question was posed in the negative calls for some “cognitive effort”
on SJ’s part—possibly enough to result in stress and hence a “lie detected”
result.

High level of trust in SJ’s work and ethics

Linda Kim’s evidence seems to suggest that Queen Tech are already working on a competitive product. It’s not clear whether or how this would be aided by corporate espionage.

From the lab schematics diagram, SJ’s desk is immediately next to the entry/exit. It’s not made clear where/how the “security team” review materials prior to release from the lab. Location of printer isn’t specified.

  1. Body building 2. Fertility/sexual concerns 3. Both of the above

There is no evidence to show these drugs are actually taken by SJ.

Hours worked and printing/scanning report

|

Difficult to draw conclusions about work patterns, particularly given the nature of project work and SJ’s relative “free hand” given by his manager, Linda Kim.

  * One incident appears to bear looking at more closely—printing of 8 documents on a Sunday morning with only ½ hour on the office. 

It’s possible these documents were printed to take to a conference, but the conference wasn’t directly related to SJ’s work responsibilities/project.

Financial forecasting:

**_Current_**  
_Earnings: $10 million

Earnings: $15 million  
Stock price: $5.50  
**Forecasts** – no MAX10 launch:  
Earnings: $8 million

|

Future business success is tied to the launch of the MAX10. Doubtless this will encourage investors and hence build a solid asset base which will allow further R&D/product innovation.

Linda Kim states SJ is pivotal to the successful launch of MAX10.

Social media posts and media stories:

  * News articles, interviews with Tzuyu Lee at Queen Tech
  * Shane’s IG posts: new car; red hand “enough” (anti-bullying sentiment); beers at pub (“needed this”); convention hall (positive sentiment). 
  * Brian’s IG posts: new car (same image as Shane’s); brunch with “these beautiful people”. 

|

  * New car appears to be a joint purchase and has been identified as a Hyundai i30 Fastback N 2019 model costing $41,990.
  * It’s possible the reference to “these beautiful people” could be potential surrogates for an IVF procedure. Speculative at this stage.
  * Media stories on Tzuyu Lee indicate a strong moral stance on corporate espionage and suggest a pipeline of new product development that they believe exceeds that of their competitors. However, given SJ has been at UA for some three years, this might indicate **IF** he has been stealing IP, it has been going on for a long time.

Emails to HR:

  * Anonymous states that SJ is stealing IP and working for Queen Tech.
  * SJ claims he is upset by what he considers homophobic comments made by Paul Gertrude and James Bourne.

|

  * The anonymous emailer provides no evidence or specific assertions as to how they know SJ is stealing. We need to consider the allegation as possibly true, but also could be motivated by malice/jealousy, etc. 
  * The anonymous emailer quotes SJ’s employee ID number. This may suggest someone with insider information on Shane.
  *  It’s not clear from SJ’s email whether the comments were directed at him personally or whether he just found them generally offensive. He seems to be genuinely seeking advice on how to handle himself.
