# Shane Jeffries is unlikely to be engaged in IP theft from UA

  
The raw probability that  Shane Jeffries is engaged in IP theft is 48%. This is the combination of the probability that he lied on the 4th polygraph question (13%), with the finding that he has displayed both "scanning" and "access" behaviours in the last 6 weeks. However, the weakness of the direct evidence against him leads to us conclude that the actual probability of such activity is more likely in the range 20--30%.

The probability that the result of SJ's drug test is a **false negative** is 7% .

## Key Judgments

  * SJ is the victim of a malicious campaign by a co-worker, and is planning to leave the company.
  * There is a worrying level of interpersonal rivalry/conflict in the Technical and Product Development Team which needs to be addressed
  * SJ should be offered an opportunity to air his concerns and grievances, every effort should be made to address these to preserve UA's reputation as a company that attracts and keeps the most technically talented people, and for the future viability of the company. A possible first step would be for his line manager to reach out to him, using the "odd hours" behaviour as the pretext, and offer personal leave
  * The polygraph "evidence" is unreliable, and possibly also irrelevant.
  * The bank transactions pertain to a private surrogacy arrangement.
  * There is a 60-70% chance that UA will fail to release the MAX10 as planned if SJ resigns or is terminated; making the expected cost to the company of his leaving of the order of $6 million in revenue over the next year, and a 7% drop in value (share price)

# Reasoning

There are essentially two pieces of direct "evidence" for the hypothesis that SJ is engaged in corporate espionage or IP theft.

  1. The handwritten note, delivered to HR's mailbox, accusing him of this. 2. His extremely irregular working hours and "odd" behaviour over the last 3 weeks.  

In addition, we have some ambiguous polygraph evidence; inconclusive IT usage records, and "suspicious" bank transactions.

Considering each of these in turn:

### 1\. The "tip" to HR was a malicious act by a team rival, most likely James Bourne

  * The "informant" appears very keen not to be identified -- the note was hand-written and hand-delivered to a physical mailbox. It was also expressed in rather childish terms -- eg. "giving away all our hard work"
  * JB also informed on SJ's "odd hours" to their manager, and explicitly linked this to his desire to have his (JB's) work receive higher priority
  *  When called out for remarks that SJ felt were "inappropriate" (homophobic), JB did not respond at all, possibly indicating a deeper level of hostility than casual bigotry or dislike. This contrasts with the conventionally dismissive response given by the other party to the conversation (Paul Gertrude).

### 2.  The irregular working hours are a reaction to the interpersonal conflict with co-workers

  * Up until 3 weeks ago SJ's working hours were entirely regular.
  * The timing of his absences in week T-3 would accord with an interstate trip: fly out on Wednesday afternoon; return late on Thursday. The purpose of the absence is unknown; one possibility is to attend a conference, perhaps the conference mentioned in his instagram post about a week later. 
  * On the Monday of week T-2 he throws himself back into work; not leaving until 11pm.
  * The next day he leaves at 3pm; later it is discovered that he sent an email to HR about this time regarding the "inappropriate" remarks made by his co-workers.
  * On Wednesday he arrives at 5am and leaves at 1pm; supporting the supposition that he is trying to minimize time spent in the lab with the rest of the team. We note that the lab in which they all work seems (from the schematic) rather cramped, thereby increasing the discomfort occasioned by the conflict.
  * The rest of week T-2 he seems to be waiting for a response from HR; none was received.
  * By Week T-1 he has apparently decided enough is enough (ref. the "enough" image posted on instagram about this time), and seems to be preparing to leave UA. He comes in for 2 hours on Monday, leaves early on Thursday, isn't seen on Friday; and comes in on the weekend just to do a heap of copying and printing. We conjecture that he has always intended at some point to start his own business, and has now decided to advance this plan (ref. the book on Startups, and the StartCon pamphlet).

### 3.  The polygraph "evidence" is both unreliable and irrelevant.

  * A very high probability of both false positive and false negatives, combined with the very low incidence of IP theft in the relevant population (2%) implies the machine has only a 13% chance of correctly detecting a lie (based on a single question).
  * We note however, that we have only the first 4 questions in what was presumably a longer interview. The first 3 are warmup questions, meant to establish as baseline for truthful responses and allow the subject to relax. The 4th question is one to which there is only 1 acceptable response ("No"), yet any person with an imagination would have to answer "yes" if they were being completely truthful. It is possible that this was actually a control question --- ref. [Scientific Validity of Polygraph Testing: A Research Review and Evaluation, chpt 2.]

  * We also note that UA Recruitment did not "follow up" the alleged inconsistencies -- perhaps because they also believe that the test is unreliable and/or irrelevant.

### 4\. The "scanning" and "access" behaviour is at most inconclusive

  *  When combined with the apparent lie on the polygraph test the presence of these behaviours implies a 48% probability that SJ "has or will perpetrate acts of IP theft or espionage".
  * If we discount the polygraph results entirely, beginning instead with the 2% probability of IP theft in the relevant population, then this falls to 11%.

### 5\. The bank transactions pertain to a private surrogacy arrangement

  1. The evidence for the surrogacy arrangement is highly circumstantial; largely resting on the supposition(1) that SJ is in a stable long-term relationship with his partner (Brian Diaz), yet is apparently taking a cocktail of medications related to male infertility(2). We also note BD's recent post regarding brunch with "these beautiful people"; referring to a female couple who might be "MJ and SC". 2. The $9,800 transfer to "MJ and SC" to "cover costs" is then for the additional insurance cover to cover the `gap' in normal health insurance. This doesn't cover IVF and is usually around \$9-14K in Australia. 3. GIFT or [Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer] is an IVF procedure that involves fertilisation of an egg with sperm from a donor. The cost of this treatment in Australia is around \$20,000(3)

(1)Supported by the fact that SJ & BD have a joint back account

(2)As found in the Security check of SJ's workdesk.

(3)This does require a somewhat roundabout transaction chain to account for the inconsistent direction of the transfer --see Fig.1 below

## Contending hypotheses

### 1\. SJ is engaged in IP theft, motivated largely by unhappiness with his treatment by UA

The argument here follows from that outlined above, except SJ is now focused on launching his own company, and, feeling no particular loyalty to UA because he feels mistreated, is actively taking steps to maximize his chance of success by stealing work currently under development, either in the expectation of being able to further develop it himself, or to sell to a 3rd party. In this scenario  the book on visual cryptography  was acquired for this purpose. A possible scheme might work as follows:

  1. SJ brings his phone to work, as usual, with some photos on it. The phone goes into the locker on the outside wall of the lab. It is not switched off. 2. The  phone locker happens to be on the other side of the wall from SJ's desk; unless the lab has been setup as a Faraday cage it would be possible for SJ to connect to the phone from his workstation; download the photos from it; add the encryption layer, and send them back to the phone. 3. If the room is a Faraday cage he would need to breach it; the feasibility of this depends on the nature of the wall.

**Counter-argument:**  if SJ had in fact decided to help himself to the team's work, surely he would not be acting in such a way as to bring negative attention on himself while he did it.

If SJ _was_ engaged in IP theft then the question of whether the "3rd party" is in fact Queen Tech (QT) becomes relevant. Here we note that

  1. SJ is on very good terms with Peyton Winger, his former boss at NewTekDev (NDT) 2. Peyton Winger is married to Tzuyu Lee, the head of technology development at QT 3. Tzuyu Lee has very recently claimed to be certain of "matching and exceeding " whatever their competitors put forward. 4. SJ and his partner Brian Diaz have recently received $21,900 labelled "GIFT" from an unknown source using a legal firm as an intermediary.

Supporting evidence for the "Startup" hypothesis  is the possession of ‘How to Start a Startup: The Silicon Valley Playbook for Entrepreneurs’  and a StartCon 2020 brochure. A potential counterargument is the purchase of the car; while not wildly expensive (the car is a Hyundai i30 N-line), he would surely want to preserve as much capital as he can, if only for contingencies.

### 2\. SJ is not engaged in IP theft, but has let it be known that he is leaving UA

The impact here could be just as serious, because it's immediate. If Linda Kim is right, and the MAX10 launch depends crucially on SJ's input, then it will fail if he leaves beforehand (the launch is in 3 weeks). In this scenario, SJ lets PW know of his problems at UA; perhaps in return for a modest consideration, with the result that TL knows that UA will likely not have a product to present at the SOUND Forum.

## Key assumptions

  1.   That SJ's atypical behaviour of the last few weeks is indicative of a man in turmoil, not a singularly reckless thief.

## Key unknowns

  1. Where was SJ on the days in week T-3 and T-1 when he was absent from work? 
  2. Why has there been no review of the secure lab's network and server logs for the most recent 3 weeks?

## Impact on UA's viability

The UA Finance Dept. have produced a pair of projections for the next year.

  1. The MAX10 launch is successful: earnings increase 50%; the share price increases 10%
  2. The MAX10 launch is not successful: earnings fall 20%; the share price falls 10%

Accordingly, if Linda Kim is correct, and the MAX10 is certain to fail if SJ resigns or is dismissed, then the situation seems clear: every effort must now be made to persuade SJ that he does indeed have a future at UA, and his concerns will be addressed.

While LK is SJ's line manager, she seems to be doubling as the project manager; if so we can assume she knows what she's talking about. On the other hand, she has apparently missed the growing dysfunction and disaffection in her team, and is perhaps overstating the case.

If we assign a credibility of 70% to LK's assessment in this regard, and assign a possibly generous 80% to the probability that the MAX10 will succeed if SJ doesn't leave(1), we can compute the expected earnings and share price for the next year under the 2 scenarios "SJ leaves", and "SJ stays". Under these assumptions the difference in earnings between the two  cases is less than \$4,000,000; naturally, the lower the value we assign to LK's credibility, the smaller this becomes. See the calculations in the relevant section of the Appendix.

(1)this is primarily to illustrate the argument; UA must have done an assessment that would suggest a value for this probability; however it has not been provided to RTCG.

# Appendix

## Probability calculations

PQ1.  What is the probability that SJ lied on Question D?

  * Let D= "Shane Jeffries lied when he answered Question D"; and B= "failed polygraph test". The posterior probability of D given B is

    Pr(D|B)=((Pr(B|D)Pr(D))/(Pr(B|D)Pr(D)+Pr(B|D)Pr(D)))

  *  We are told "only 2% of participants are involved in insider IP theft or espionage (and lie on their polygraph)". If we note that D is better described as the compound event "SJ is/was considering insider IP theft or espionage (and lied about it)" then this is the prior probability Pr(D).
  *  We are also given Pr(failing the polygraph test even though you're innocent)=Pr(B|D)=12%, and Pr(passing the polygraph test even though you're guilty)=Pr(B|D)=11%. 
  *  Hence Pr(D)=0.98, Pr(B|D)=0.89, and the posterior probability of D given B is

    Pr(D|B)=((0.89×0.02)/(0.89×0.02+0.12×0.98))=0.13146

  
**Conclusion: the probability that SJ lied when he answered question D is 13%.**

PQ2. Given the findings of the `Indicators Check', and assuming an initial probability of theft equivalent to the probability that Shane lied on the polygraph, what is the probability that Shane has or will perpetrate acts of IP theft or espionage?

  *  Let D= "Shane Jeffries has or will perpetrate acts of IP theft or espionage"; C= "displays scanning behaviour"; A= "displays `access' behaviour". 
  *  We are given Pr(C|D)=63%; Pr(C|D)=1/3; Pr(A|D)=81%, and Pr(A|D)=25%.
  *  The prior probability of D is Pr(D|B)=0.13146⇔Pr(D|B)=0.86854. The posterior probability of D given B and C is therefore

    Pr(D|C) = ((Pr(C|D)Pr(D|B))/(Pr(C|D)Pr(D|B)+Pr(C|D)Pr(D|B))) = ((0.63×0.13146)/(0.63×0.13146+(1/3)×0.86854)) = 0.22243

  *  Taking this as the prior probability for the next stage   posterior probability of D given B and C and A:

    Pr(D|A) = ((Pr(A|D)Pr(D|B,C))/(Pr(A|D)Pr(D|B,C)+Pr(A|D)Pr(D|B,C))) = ((0.81×0.22243)/(0.81×0.22243+0.25×(1-0.22243))) = 0.48101

  
**Conclusion: given the failed polygraph test, and the presence of the "scanning" and "access" indicators, the final probability that SJ "has or will perpetrate acts of IP theft or espionage" is 48%.**

       

PQ3. What is the probability that the drug test result is a false negative reading?

  * Let D= "SJ is using drugs"; N= "test was -ive"; P= "test was +ive". 
  * We have prior probability Pr(D)=28% (since SJ is 27 years old). 
  * The posterior is given by

    Pr(D|N)=((Pr(N|D)Pr(D))/(Pr(N|D)Pr(D)+Pr(N|D)Pr(D)))

  * For the new test kit Pr(P|D)=93% and Pr(P|D)=6%, implying Pr(N|D)=7% and Pr(N|D)=94%. Hence

    Pr(D|N) = ((0.07×0.28)/(0.07×0.28+0.94×(1-0.28))) = 0.028145

  * For the old test kit Pr(P|D)=81% and Pr(P|D)=23%, implying Pr(N|D)=19% and Pr(N|D)=77%. Hence

    Pr(D|N) = ((0.19×0.28)/(0.19×0.28+0.77×(1-0.28))) = 0.087558

  * The kit was selected randomly from stores containing 69% old kits => the final probability is

    Pr(D|N) = Pr(D|N∩newkit)Pr(newkit)+Pr(D|N∩oldkit)Pr(oldkit)  
     = 0.028145×0.31+0.087558×0.69  
     = 0.06914

  
**Conclusion: the probability that SJ was using drugs, despite the negative test result, is 7%.**

## Impact on the financial projections

Linda Kim (LK) appears to believe that the MAX10 is  **certain  **to fail if SJ leaves.

The following combines an assessment of LK's credibility with the potential impact on UA of SJ's resignation or dismissal.
