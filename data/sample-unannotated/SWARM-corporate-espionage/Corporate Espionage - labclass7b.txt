**Report #1 - Corporate Espionage**

**Key Judgements  **

Based on an analysis of the information provided on the employee, as well as taking into account calculated probabilities, it seems unlikely that Shane Jeffries is currently or will be involved in corporate espionage at Ultimate Audio (UA).

**Probability Tests**

To help inform our assessment of Shane’s suitability to hold a position at UA we examined the results of a polygraph test and an Indicator’s check.

First, we looked at Shane’s answers to UA’s polygraph test compulsory for all newly recruited staff members. The polygraph test indicated that Shane lied on Question D: Is there any reason why you would not maintain the confidentiality and secrecy requirements of a role with UA?

_Q1: What is the probability that Shane lied on Question D during the polygraph?_

`chance of Lying is 2% `

`chance of ReportLying given Lying is 88% `

`chance of ReportLying given not Lying is 12% `

`% chance of Lying given ReportLying? 13%`

Results show that there was a 13% chance that Shane was actually lying on Question D during the polygraph test. For this question, we calculated the conditional probability of lying (given that only 2% of participants lie (and commit espionage) on the polygraph test. The inbuilt SWARM calculator was used:

We then looked at an IT usage report which included Shane’s results on an
‘indicator’s check’. An indicator’s check reviews a user’s (1) scanning and (2) access activities. Analysts found indicators of both scanning and access on Shane’s file.

_Q2: Given the findings of the ‘Indicators Check’, and assuming an initial probability of theft equivalent to the probability that Shane lied on the polygraph, what is the probability that Shane has or will perpetrate acts of IP theft or espionage?  _

For this question, we first generated a conditional probability table which showed that given indicators of both scanning and access, Shane’s probability of theft is 93%. We used:

<https://lenskit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LK/pages/99975245/Conditional+Probability+Table+Calculator>

Cause variable names |   | Conditional Probabilities |   | UNBBayes Layout |
|   |   |  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Scanning | Probability of Espionage given Scanning | 0.63 |   | Scanning |
TRUE | FALSE  
Access | Probability of Espionage given Access | 0.81 |   | Access | TRUE |
FALSE | TRUE | FALSE  
  |   |   |   | Espionage TRUE | 0.9297 | 0.63 | 0.81 | 0  
Effect variable name |   |   |   | Espionage FALSE | 0.0703 | 0.37 | 0.19 | 1  
Espionage |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  
  

We then calculated the combined probability of Shane committing espionage based on the results of Q1 and the conditional probability table. Given the Indicators Check and Polygraph Test, the probability of theft/espionage is:

(93% + 13%)/2 = 53%

Taking into account the results form both the polygraph test and indicators check, the aggregated probability of Shane committing espionage is 53%.

_Conclusion_ : Given that the statistical probability of Shane committing espionage is 53%, we cannot confidently say that Shane has or will perpetrate acts of theft or espionage. We therefore have to turn towards other forms of information available to us to provide an assessment of Shane’s suitability to hold a position at UA.

**Drug test**

Although we are confident that testing the team will obfuscate the specific interest in Shane Jeffries, we also looked at Shane’s results on a randomised drug test conducted by UA. UA views prohibited drug use as a vulnerability, which increases the risk an employee will engage in acts detrimental to the company.

Shane tested negative on the DrugDetector3000 (DD3). However, due to a logistical issue, we are unsure of the model used for Shane’s test.

_Q3: Given that we do not know which model Security Officers used to test the sample and that Shane’s test was negative, what is the probability that the result is a false negative reading?  _

p(false negative from DD3-U)

= 1 - p(true positive from DD3-U)

= 1 - 93%

= 7%

p(false negative from DD3-O)

= 1 - p(true positive from DD3-O)

= 1 - 81%

= 19%

p(using a DD3-O) = 69%

p(using a DD3-U) = 31%

p(receiving a false negative from DD3-O) + p(receiving a false negative from DD3-U)

= (63%x19%) + (31%x7%)

= 15.28%

Results show that there is a 15.28% chance that Shane's drug test resulted in a false negative. To help us with this question we used the Probability Translation Guide:

<https://lenskit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LK/pages/91455689/Probability+Translation+Guide>

_Conclusion_ : The calculations suggest that Shane’s negative result is accurate. Based on UA’s reasoning of randomised drug tests, this decreases the risk that Shane will engage in acts detrimental to the company.

**Other Factors**

In addition to the probability tests, we also analysed other forms of evidence which decreases Shane's possibility of committing espionage.

_Manager’s Interview (Linda Kim)_

  * Kim has described Shane as her ‘best employee’ and as someone who can be trusted and committed to UA.
  * Kim also explains that Shane has always been open and transparent about his previous employment at Queen tech and ‘did not try to hide it’.
  * Kim is confident that without Shane, the MAX10 project would fall apart. This means, regardless of whether Shane is or is not involved in espionage, the company will risk losing to Queen tech at the SOUND FORUM.
  * Kim mentioned that Shane has previously underwent (and passed) separate drug and polygraph tests for a project under the Department of Defence.

_UA Lab’s schematics  _

  * The lab schematics provided by Kim shows that Shane’s desk is openly positioned next to the lab’s entrance. 
  * This shows that almost everyone working in the lab can very easily view what Shane's activities on his workstation- no storage units blocking the view, in an area passed by everyone entering and leaving the lab.

**Credibility of Anonymous Report**

Over the course of Shane’s employment at UA, there has only been one report exposing Shane’s alleged espionage. Evidence shows that one employee - James Bourne has raised this suspicion previously and therefore may be the anonymous reporter.

Based on his email to Linda questioning Shane’s trustworthiness, James suggests that Linda prioritise his work over Shane’s instead. This points to a motive to accuse Shane of espionage.

Based on an email Shane sent HR, there was a previous conflict between him and two of his colleagues, one of them being James. Shane raised that James made homophobic comments. This conflict between the two of them points to a second motive to accuse Shane of espionage.

In conclusion, UA needs to be cautious in trusting the anonymous report. Should this be a false report by James Bourne, UA risks damaging their reputation for their incompetence in responding to Shane’s concern as well as ensuring an inclusive non-homophobic workplace.

**Alternative Explanations**

One detail which might suggest some form of unusual activity which leads one to suspect Shane of espionage is the progressively odd working hours over the course of his employment.

A possible explanation for this is that Shane is increasingly stressed from both the project as well as the conflict with his colleagues. It is not uncommon for an employee to work odd hours leading up to a big project. Other evidence which suggest that his odd working hours are due to stress include:

  * Stress ball on his desk
  * Medication and pills on his desk
  * Social media posts (‘Needed this’ and ‘Be nice to people - it’s not that hard’)

**Unknowns  **

  * Unknown mobile number Shane calls the most
  * Bank account transactions raised by UA Security 
  * Shane’s relationship with Peyton Winger
  * The Serophene pills at Shane's desk

**Conclusion**

Based on both probability tests and circumstantial evidence, we believe that it is not likely that Shane Jeffries is involved in corporate espionage and is therefore suitable to retain his role at UA. Given the potential loss of an estimated $7 million, we suggest that UA continues to employ Shane Jeffries to ensure the release of MAX10 at the upcoming SOUND FORUM.
